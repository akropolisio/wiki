Call LoanModule.repay(debt, lAmount) to execute operation. Distributions When borrower repays some part of his loan, he uses some PTK (either from his balance or minted when he sends DAI to the pool). This PTKs are distributed to supporters, proportionally to the part of the loan they covered. The borrower himself also covered half of the loan, and his part is distributed over the whole pool. All users of the pool receive part of this distributions proportional to the amount of PTK they hold on their balance and in loan proposals, PTK locked as collateral for loans is not counted. Distribution mechanics When you need to distribute some amount of tokens over all token holders one's first straight-forward idea might be to iterate through all token holders, check their balance and increase it by their part of the distribution. Unfortunately, this approach can hardly be used in Ethereum blockchain. All operations in EVM cost some gas. If we have a lot of token holders, gas cost for iteration through all may be higher than a gas limit for transaction (which is currently equal to gas limit for block). Instead, during distribution we just store amount of PTK to be distributed and current amount of all PTK qualified for distribution. And user balance is only updated by separate request or when it is going to be changed by transfer, mint or burn. During this \"lazy\" update we go through all distributions occured between previous and current update. Now, one may ask what if there is too much distributions occurred in the pool between this updated and the gas usage to iterate through all of them is too high again? Obvious solution would be to allow split such transaction to several smaller ones, and we've implemented this approach. But we also decided to aggregate all distributions during a day. This way we can protect ourself from dust attacks, when somebody may do a lot of small repays which cause a lot of small distributions. When a distribution request is received by PToken we check if it's time to actually create new distribution. If it's not, we just add distribution amount to the accumulator. When time comes (and this condition is also checked by transfers, mints and burns), actual distribution is created using accumulated amount of PTK and total supply of qualified PTK.","title":"AkropolisOS"},{"location":"akropolisOS/#akropolisos","text":"AkropolisOS is A Solidity framework for building complex dApps and protocols (savings, pensions, loans, investments).

All users of the pool receive part of this distributions proportional to the amount of PTK they hold on their balance and in loan proposals, PTK locked as collateral for loans is not counted.","title":"Distributions"},{"location":"akropolisOS/#distribution-mechanics","text":"When you need to distribute some amount of tokens over all token holders one's first straight-forward idea might be to iterate through all token holders, check their balance and increase it by their part of the distribution. Unfortunately, this approach can hardly be used in Ethereum blockchain. All operations in EVM cost some gas. If we have a lot of token holders, gas cost for iteration through all may be higher than a gas limit for transaction (which is currently equal to gas limit for block). Instead, during distribution we just store amount of PTK to be distributed and current amount of all PTK qualified for distribution. And user balance is only updated by separate request or when it is going to be changed by transfer, mint or burn. During this \"lazy\" update we go through all distributions occured between previous and current update. Now, one may ask what if there is too much distributions occurred in the pool between this updated and the gas usage to iterate through all of them is too high again? Obvious solution would be to allow split such transaction to several smaller ones, and we've implemented this approach. But we also decided to aggregate all distributions during a day. This way we can protect ourself from dust attacks, when somebody may do a lot of small repays which cause a lot of small distributions. When a distribution request is received by PToken we check if it's time to actually create new distribution. If it's not, we just add distribution amount to the accumulator. When time comes (and this condition is also checked by transfers, mints and burns), actual distribution is created using accumulated amount of PTK and total supply of qualified PTK.","title":"Distribution mechanics"},{"location":"akropolisfaq/","text":"Akropolis FAQ Product What is Akropolis? Akropolis is a DeFi yield farming and Dollar Cost Averaging tool that offers synthetic savings and high yield \u201caccounts\u201d aimed at DeFi-curious users with no deep technical knowledge and some understanding of Ethereum and crypto. Akropolis was built by the Akropolis team and is the second product built on AkropolisOS. Why Akropolis? Today, DeFi provides great opportunities for earning money through staking, yield farming and liquidity provision. However, different DeFi protocols offer various opportunities for yield generation & yield farming which may confuse DeFi newbies & people who do not have time to follow the news constantly. Akropolis allocate different yield-farming & yield-generating pools in one interface, solving an important problem for novice DeFi users - simple & user-friendly interface with concise and understandable information. Another important feature is the ability to set an automated dollar-cost average (DCA) strategy into assets/liquidity pools - oriented at users who want to set up a long-term portfolio. Akropolis decreases operational costs for such operations as all funds are pooled and batched to minimize gas costs. Akropolis also gives special attention to UI/UX design to make it simple & understandable for the end-users (novice or experts) - we are constantly improving it & adding more user-friendly features per community feedback and best practices in the space. Yearn Vaults On the Vaults tab you can find the Yearn strategies v1&v2 integrated. This is the automised product to maximase your yield-farming gains. To learn more about Yearn Vaults please visit the Yearn Documantation and FAQ . DCA (in progress) Dollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and the crypto community. To put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as \u201cstacking sats\u201d in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase price/cost basis. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices. Stake Currently, stake tab has only one pool - AKRO staking. Mechanics here are simple - you just send AKRO to this pool & farm AKRO/ADEL. No lock-up. To learn how to stake please visit our Simple staking FAQ The actual staking reward amounts could be checked here . How to stake? Open Akropolis app Connect wallet with AKRO on it Go to staking page Click Stake Choose amount Confirm Confirm approval transaction (gas fees) Confirm deposit transaction (gas fee) Chill \ud83c\udf1a What is vesting? Vesting is a lockup model for incentivizing long-term users and tokenholders. Each day of rewards is locked for 1 year with bi-weekly distributions. You can find the total vested amount and unlocked amount in My Rewards . Take a note, that rewards distribute after its amount reach 10,000 AKRO and 500 ADEL. The percentage bar in My Rewards displays reaching the threshold for the distribution. Akropolis Functionality How to allocate liquidity? Enable Allocate switcher to choose pools you want to deposit into Choose the amount & tokens you would like to put in each pool Click the Allocate button to deposit in one transaction (additional transactions may come in a form of \u201capprove spending\u201d) That\u2019s it. Your funds are sent to corresponding pools/strategies where they earn yield & farm tokens. What's \"Add all coins in a balanced proportion\"? Each liquidity pool has a balanced ratio for assets within it - by depositing tokens in a balanced proportion, you decrease the chance of swap (leading to fewer gas fees & swap fees). What's \"Infinite unlock\"? Infinite unlock means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of tokens when you interact with it. Enabling infinite unlock means that you approve spending tokens only once (thus reducing gas costs associated with signing \u201capprove\u201d transaction). Bear in mind - after enabling infinite unlock, all following transfers/deposit of the asset chosen won\u2019t need approval - so please use it if you fully trust the contract.

You can attract additional liquidity without using a 150% ensuring in digital assets by trading C2FC. How does it work An already operating business or an individual who has regular income payments, that needs additional liquidity at the moment can issue C2FC for defined future periods and trade them at marketplace. It looks like exchanging future cashflows for \"money now\" by selling discounted C2FC or borrowing funds, using C2FC as collateral. Are there any risks involved in issuing or trading C2FCs? C2FC issuance itself does not provide any risks until it is involved in the open market. When it is exchanged to other unit of value and changed ownership, there is a risk that future cashflow would be lower than estimated or there would no money arrived at all. This issue primarily is connected with the correct risk assessment of the C2FC issuer.

Our pool automates the work of financial organizations, and solves the following challenges: Risk assessment of different investment instruments Lending funds with the maximum percentage, taking loss risk into account Liquidity provision to avoid cash gap and subsequent bankruptcy The goal of our pool is to create a community-owned fund that helps its members earn high-interest rates by providing unsecured loans to its members and by providing capital to various liquid DeFi instruments. Motivation / Objective / Features Uncollateralised lending available through the pooling of funds. Currently, in DeFi most lending is over-collateralised. Maximise earnings to its members Incentives for early adopters/users of the pool Incentives to grow the pool size through referrals Incentivized behavior Early membership is incentivized by the bonding curve Pools growth is incentivized by borrowers as it leads to decreasing of loan's interest rate Incentivize responsible credit risk assessment - risk assessors act as guarantors for the credit and their funds are at risk of being slashed in the case of wrong assessment. Active voting (equivalent to risk assessment) is incentivized \u2013 only active voters i.e. guarantors earn money in the pool. Improvements over traditional / legacy models Use of bonding curve economically incentivises early participants Automates the treasury operations (responsible for having enough liquid assets to cover the pool's obligations) by stimulating the attraction of new members while reducing the size of liquid assets in a pool. Automates \"ragequitting\" in case of disagreements with decisions made in the pool. Definitions and principles Initial deposits only in DAI. Akropolis Sparta Pool Token (ASPT) \u2013 ERC20 token of DAO. Gives the right to vote for governance/investment decision and to get uncollateralized loan. Ragequit - immediate pool leaving mechanism without funds blocked in DAO (in case you haven't staked (voted for) anyone). Bonding curve \u2013 mathematical curve defining price/supply correlation. ASPT Role and purpose: what is the role of the ASPT? ASPT is classified as a Network Token, combining the Work token and Governance functionality. It provides voting and staking functionalities within the Pool, and gives the right to get an uncollateralized loan. As such, the token is an essential element of the internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin. The staking and governance approach require to be managed only by using a token, which value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects/networks. The specific DAO-design also requires an internal token to implement functions as bonding curve and ragequit. Meanwhile, the loans will be provided in known and reliable stablecoins (DAI, USDT, TUSD, USDC), which will be further used to repay loans. The ASPT will not be used for this purpose. How will the ASPT model work in the network? ASPT as collateral We use an approach that we call a \u201cCommunity grant\u201d - all platform loans are 100% secured. The user pledges his ASPTs as collateral (the deposit should be no less than 50% of the loan amount, i.e. the user will not be able to take a loan more than 200% relative to the size of ASPTs that he has). The Pool members who consider the user to be a good borrower, vouch for him and lock their ASPTs as collateral. If the sum of the ASPTs locked (both borrower and pool members) equals the size of the loan, then the borrower receives a loan in a stablecoins (DAI, USDT, TUSD, USDC). Underlying value: what is the value of the token tied to? The value of the ASPT is tied to the real assets held in the DAO. Each time stablecoins is deposited or withdrawn, ASPT is minted or burned. The ASPT price is defined by the bonding curve algorithm. It should be noted that the token holder does not receive any profits by simply holding the token. ASPT does not grant the right to receive any profits, income, payments, returns, dividends from Akropolis or any entity from its group of companies, nor is it intended to be a security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any kind of financial instrument or investment carrying equivalent rights. How does it work? Entering and leaving the pool A DAO is a community-owned organization where community members collectively made decisions regarding fund management. This can scare people away from entering or leaving the DAO as their funds may be blocked in the DAO, for one reason or another. To solve this problem, we use the Continuous Token Model. Users can enter and exit the DAO by buying and selling ASPTs price of which is determined by the bonding curve (mathematical curve defining price/supply correlation). This approach not only solves the problem of potential funds lock but also gives an additional incentive for the first users due to the bonding curve design. The cost of the token on the bonding curve depends on the amount of liquidity in the pool: with increasing liquidity, the cost of the DAO token increases, while lesser liquidity decreases it. However, exiting the DAO using the bonding curve exposes the liquidity problem - what if someone wants to exit the pool with no liquidity? (for example, all liquid assets are distributed to borrowers). In our case, such a situation is impossible due to the design of the pool. \"Ragequit\" is a mechanism for leaving the pool at any moment, if you haven't staked (voted to give a loan) for somebody. MolochDAO was first to introduce this approach. We implemented our own variation of \"ragequit\" using the Bonding Curve mechanism. More on it in \"Bonding curve section\" \u0421redit issuance One of the main use cases of our product is attracting unsecured (uncollateralized) credit by pool users. Why the creation of such a product is so important to us? In developing countries, unsecured credit is often considered as the only tool to improve life quality (see Grameen Bank, Chamas, etc.), because people there don't have access to the proper banking system. At the same time, most existing DeFi products offer over-collateralized lending that attracts only specific users - either traders who want more leverage for trading or holders who believe in asset growth but need DAI to pay for current expenses. Our focus is on building financial products for underbanked people, who are not knowledgeable on the crypto market. But how can we guarantee the system stability and decrease to a minimum possibility of lending funds to unreliable borrowers (which will lead to the cash gap in the pool)? We decided to use a social reputation system to solve this issue. Moreover, at the current level of development of decentralized services, we do not believe in opportunistic attempts to create a \"single rating / scoring\" for all users. We have chosen to use a simpler approach in our product, which we call \"Community grant\" - all platform loans must be 100% secured. In addition to the user's deposit, other members of the pool can vouch for it. How it works: The user pledges his ASPTs as collateral (the deposit should be no less than 50% of the loan amount, i.e. the user will not be able to take a loan more than 200% relative to the size of ASPTs that he has) Pool members who consider the user to be a good borrower vouch for him and lock their ASPTs as collateral. If the sum of ASPTs locked (both borrower and pool members) equals to the size of the loan than the borrower receives a loan in DAI. This design leads to two main questions: How to encourage pool members to be active and vouch for potential borrowers? How to assess the borrower's risks in case of pseudo-anonymization used in Ethereum, when you know only the wallet address, but not the personal data of a person? We assume that the guarantors from the pool will know the borrower. For example, a small community of 20-30 people who trust each other and will use our platform to provide loans to each other. Interest rate share When repaying a loan in DAI, the borrower also pays interest on his loan. 50% of the interest remains in the pool, while the remaining 50% is equally distributed in the form of ASPTs between the users who vouched for the borrower, depending on their stake. The interest rate is paid by the borrower in the form of ASPT (DAI received from the borrower is used to purchase ASPT and distribute it among the guarantors). ASPTs burning If the borrower delays the repayment of the loan and does not repay (in full or in part) within the specified period: ASPTs are burned in proportion to the interest rate. If the user has X delays (for example, 6 - the governed parameter), then all ASPTs are burned In such case, ASPT supply, price, and pool liquidity decrease. ASPT role Acts as collateral for loan issuance Used to distribute interest earned after right risk assessment and repayment of the loan by borrower Right to act as a guarantor for the loan Spreads between enter and exit price of ASPT (pool earnings) used for AKRO buyback from the market and further use in the Development Fund. Bonding Curve Mechanics Bonding Curve has two prices - the purchase price and the sale price. Bonding curve uses the formula x = f(S) , where x is the number of issued tokens, and S is the pool size. There is a spread 'd' between the purchase price and the sale price, - the fee for exiting the pool. Upon entering the pool, the price is formed as follows: where A is the volume of total assets (liquid assets in Pool + debt commitments), Deposit is the size of the deposit, dx is the number of ASPTs tokens received. When you exit the pool, the price is formed as follows: Or (the same) , where L is the volume of liquid assets, x = f(L) . The sum forms the pool earnings - spread between enter and exit price of ASPT, amount of money user gets. To calculate f(S) we propose to use the following formula Preventing attacks on the pool Let's suppose there are x funds in the pool and f(x) liquid tokens accordingly. Let's also suppose a fraudster wants to take a loan m , . The fraudster has accomplices with the amount of funds P . To process the attack, the accomplices pre-enter the pool, which in turn increases the cost of ASPTs, then vote for the fraudster and he gets a loan. After that, the fraudster accomplices leave the pool. If no one spots it , they will be able to repeat such a scheme over and over again, leading to pool bankrupcy. Let's check under which conditions would this be possible: Accomplices enter the pool, buying G = f(x + P) - f(x) tokens for the amount of funds P , where f(x + P) stands for liquid tokens in the pool. Pool liquidity increases and has x + P liquidity. Fraudster gets a loan m . To do this, he and his accomplices lock Q = f(x + p)-f(x + p - m) tokens, whereas f(x + p - m) is liquid tokens in the pool and x + p - m is the pool liquidity. Fraudster accomplices own G - Q liquid ASPTs. They take them out and get H = x + P - m - f^{-1}[f(x + p - m)- G + Q] for them. As a result, the fraudster and his accomplices have m + H funds. If m + H vs P , then the fraudsters made money: As f is an increasing function, the sign will be equivalent to the Let's add G and Q values: Based on the above, vs is equivalent to '=' . P sign does not matter in this case ( P could be positive and could be negative which is equivalent that accomplices leave pool first, and then join again). Q.E.D., cooperation with fake pool members will not give any advantage to the fraudster. Ragequit mechanics: A. Let's suppose that there are L1 liquid assets in the pool and f(L1) tokens accordingly. The pool has not issued any loans yet. B. Next, let's imagine the following situation - the dL1 liquidity was added to the pool and tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) were issued. C. Next, the pool issued a loan in the amount of dL1 . All issued tokens are now locked and L1 liquid assets and f(L1) liquid tokens remain in the pool. If the loan was not repaid, then all the locked tokens got burned. After this, participants with liquid tokens will be able to exit, as there is f(L1) tokens and L1 liquidity. If the loan was repaid and during this time no one entered the pool, then we return to the situation B and everyone will be able to leave the pool. If more people entered the pool, and the loan has not yet been returned: let's assume that dL2 liquidity was added to the pool and contributors received the tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) - f(L1 + dL1) . The pool has liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2)-f(L1 + dL1) + f(L1) . Let's assume all participants want to leave the pool. They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design: f\u2019\u2019(L1)dL1dL2 < 0 is true because of f\u2019\u2019<0 . Let's now assume that loan has been returned. All locked tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) will be unlocked. The pool will now have liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) . They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design. This logic can be generalized to an arbitrary number of credits / affiliations in the DAO. AKRO Governance Our management system is similar in its principles to the MakerDAO governance. By purchasing and staking AKRO pool tokens, the user can participate in the system governance - vote for changes in bonding curve parameters, collateralization level, buyback parameters, etc. It can be done only by AKRO holders (and not ASPTs holders) to prevent pool members from abusing their power (e.g. entering the pool, change bonding curve and make ASPTs too expensive to enter the pool for future members). Roles on the platform Economic Objectives How does token help? Borrower Have access to an unsecured creditHave a regular availability of credit The token issued equivalently to the amount of DAI allows you to leave a request for an unsecured loan in the pool and collateralize a loan. The user can get a 200% loan of the amount of ASPT available.Also, high liquidity in the pool formed by depositing funds, using a token, attracting users according to the bonding curve, implies the constant presence of a \"living\" asset available for a loan.

This approach not only solves the problem of potential funds lock but also gives an additional incentive for the first users due to the bonding curve design. The cost of the token on the bonding curve depends on the amount of liquidity in the pool: with increasing liquidity, the cost of the DAO token increases, while lesser liquidity decreases it. However, exiting the DAO using the bonding curve exposes the liquidity problem - what if someone wants to exit the pool with no liquidity?

In our case, such a situation is impossible due to the design of the pool. \"Ragequit\" is a mechanism for leaving the pool at any moment, if you haven't staked (voted to give a loan) for somebody.

Why the creation of such a product is so important to us? In developing countries, unsecured credit is often considered as the only tool to improve life quality (see Grameen Bank, Chamas, etc.), because people there don't have access to the proper banking system. At the same time, most existing DeFi products offer over-collateralized lending that attracts only specific users - either traders who want more leverage for trading or holders who believe in asset growth but need DAI to pay for current expenses. Our focus is on building financial products for underbanked people, who are not knowledgeable on the crypto market. But how can we guarantee the system stability and decrease to a minimum possibility of lending funds to unreliable borrowers (which will lead to the cash gap in the pool)? We decided to use a social reputation system to solve this issue. Moreover, at the current level of development of decentralized services, we do not believe in opportunistic attempts to create a \"single rating / scoring\" for all users. We have chosen to use a simpler approach in our product, which we call \"Community grant\" - all platform loans must be 100% secured. In addition to the user's deposit, other members of the pool can vouch for it. How it works: The user pledges his ASPTs as collateral (the deposit should be no less than 50% of the loan amount, i.e. the user will not be able to take a loan more than 200% relative to the size of ASPTs that he has) Pool members who consider the user to be a good borrower vouch for him and lock their ASPTs as collateral. If the sum of ASPTs locked (both borrower and pool members) equals to the size of the loan than the borrower receives a loan in DAI. This design leads to two main questions: How to encourage pool members to be active and vouch for potential borrowers? How to assess the borrower's risks in case of pseudo-anonymization used in Ethereum, when you know only the wallet address, but not the personal data of a person? We assume that the guarantors from the pool will know the borrower. For example, a small community of 20-30 people who trust each other and will use our platform to provide loans to each other.","title":"\u0421redit issuance"},{"location":"sparta/#interest-rate-share","text":"When repaying a loan in DAI, the borrower also pays interest on his loan. 50% of the interest remains in the pool, while the remaining 50% is equally distributed in the form of ASPTs between the users who vouched for the borrower, depending on their stake.

Sparta is a credit pool where users can get access to loans without the need of large collaterals. Its mechanics allows the Sparta users to get an undercollateralized loan, as well as provide funds at a percentage of interest. Why Sparta? Sparta model solves the over-collateralization problem in DeFi. With it, users can get access to a loan with 50% collateral. One of the advantages of our pool is that we have a collective responsibility and staking guarantee approach. Because the users are being rewarded for voting for good participants, they act as native risk assessors in the system, supporting its stability. Additionally, we implemented a bonding curve (Continuous Token Model with ASPT) to our pool. This gives an additional incentive for users to join the pool at the start of it. It also allows them to leave the pool at any moment without the problem of locked funds due to lack of liquidity assets. But what is a bonding curve? A bonding curve is a mathematical curve defining the price/supply correlation. A user enters and exit the DAO by buying and selling ASPTs on a price determined by this curve. What is the Akropolis Sparta Pool Token (ASPT)? ASPT \u2013 the native ERC20 token of the DAO, minted on the bonding curve. Gives the right to vote for investment decisions and to get access to loans. The ASPT minting is \u201cfully UI abstracted\u201d, meaning users don\u2019t need to deal with it directly. How do I use the service? Connect your wallet to our platform and deposit DAI. After that, you can start using the pool. What are the fees? Our pool does not take commissions at the moment. Participating in the pool How can I join the pool? Click on this link to access Sparta. Connect with your wallet (Bitski, Metamask, Connectwallet, Formatic, Portis, Squarelink) and deposit DAI. When you enter the pool, your entrance automatically calculates the poolToken price and you receive an equal amount of ASPT, enabling you to use the pool. How can I leave the pool? Just click \u201cwithdraw\u201d and your available funds will sell on the bonding curve price and return to your connected wallet in DAI. Please be aware that locked funds, staked for somebody\u2019s loan cannot be withdrawn until the loan paid back by the borrower. Why is my available balance different from the deposited amount? Conducting any operations in DAI, whether they\u2019re deposit or withdrawal, will be represented as ASPT in the pool. As there is a spread between entry and exit prices, as well as fluctuation of the price on the bonding curve, your actual deposit will differ from available balance. For example, after depositing 100 DAI you may see only 97 DAI available and -3 DAI in profit. Loan issuance How can I take a loan? When creating a loan request, you need to provide half of the loan amount as collateral. The pool members will need to stake additional 100% in your favour. A request with 150% collateral can only be activated by the borrower. To create a loan request, go to the Pool overview page and in the Pool information section, click the \u201cGet loan\u201d button. A pop-up will open. There, you\u2019ll need to enter the loan parameters and confirm the intention to create a deposit, then confirm the transaction sending. After creating the request, you can see it on the \u201cProposals\u201d page and on the \u201cMy loans\u201d page. How can I lend funds? Staking for a loan request allows the user to receive part of the loan interest paid by the borrower. You can become a guarantor in any loan on the Proposals page, which displays all open loan applications. To do this, select the loan and click on the Stake button. When you see the pop-up, you need to enter the amount of the deposit and confirm the intention to make it, then confirm the sending of the transaction. After making a stake on the Proposals page, you will see your share of interest that you received from the payments on this loan. All loans in which the user is the guarantor can be viewed on the page \u201cMy guarantees\u201d. Can I unstake my funds? Yes. Prior to the activation of a loan, any guarantor can withdraw a deposit from the loan request. To do this, click the \u201cUnstake\u201d button in the loan request card on the \u201cProposals\u201d page or on the \u201cMy guarantees\u201d page. In the pop-up that opens, you need to enter the amount for withdrawal and confirm the intention to withdraw the stake from the loan request, then confirm the transaction is sent. How can I repay a loan? IIn order to repay a loan, you need to click on the \u201cRepay\u201d button on the \u201cMy loan\u201d page. Next, you need to enter the amount for the cancellation and confirm the intention to perform the cancellation, then confirm the sending of the transaction. After the repayment, the loan amount displayed in the \u201cLoan\u201d column on the \u201cMy loans\u201d page should decrease, and all guarantors should unlock a part of the collateral and accrue interest. How can I claim interest? On the \u201cMy guarantees\u201d page, you can see how much interest was accumulated in the issued loans, and how much collateral is available for unlocking. The accumulated interest is displayed in the Earn column, and the Unlock X.XX DAI button will display how much can be unlocked. After clicking the Unlock X.XX DAI button, you will need to confirm the intention to withdraw funds from the loan, then confirm the sending of the transaction. Unlocked funds fall into the available balance. What happens if a loan is not repaid? In the case of non-repayment loan is liquidated 90 days after the issuance or partial repayment of. The deposited collateral will be burnt and a partial repayment (if exist) will be distributed between the users who staked for this loan. Security Where are my deposited funds stored? All user funds are stored on-chain in smart contracts, Sparta is not a custodial solution. Has your product been audited? Akropolis is currently undergoing a security audit from CertiK, which will take about a month. After the audit, the results will be announced publicly. Have you modelled potential attacks on the pool? We plan to launch a regression testing in the near future. For this, we will create scripts that we described in the YML format. As part of this approach, we will manipulate various parameters that the pool works with and monitor its behaviour. This way we can predict how the pool works under certain circumstances. Is a flashloan attack against your pool possible? These kinds of attacks do not affect the Sparta. Attacks of this type are specific to flash loans platforms. A flash loan is an unsecured form of loan that is issued for an ultra-short time. In fact everything is executed in one transaction.

Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It is designed to: enable anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow informal autonomous financial organisations (AFOs), e.g. digital co-ops, guilds, mutuals enable a previously impossible interoperable scalable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade). reduce instances of fraud and misuse of funds What is DeFi? What is your place in DeFi ecosystem? Decentralized finance (#defi) refers to a group of financial sector-focussed startups that leverages open source software and decentralized networks to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that operate without unnecessary intermediaries. DeFi is by far the most promising area of blockchain application, with a number of high-quality interoperable projects promising the future of transparent, fully auditable, efficient peer-to-peer interactions, based both on existing financial primitives and creating novel ways to generate and exchange value. We are building an alternative savings infrastructure that can be tested by informal savings groups (or AFOs) in emerging markets now. What\u2019s the main problem the project solves? Financial security and access to basic financial services without dependence on fractional reserve-based banking system, and therefore resilient to economic crises. The protocol is designed to enable scalability of informal member-owned organizations, that have existed for centuries globally and remain active in emerging markets, especially in Africa, parts of Europe, US and Asia. This is envisaged as an alternative to challenged financial institutions mandated with providing pensions/banking/social insurance and a more resilient alternative to traditional banks that rely on fractional reserve banking. How do you know it is a valid problem with verified demand? The problem of insolvency of centralised pensions and social security institutions is a well documented one. Our summary of external resources is below: Library of press articles here . Documentary \u201cThe Coming Retirement Crisis\u201d by Goldman Sachs\u2019 Raul Pal (our brief video summary is here ) Documentary \u201cThe Pension Gamble\u201d by the Frontline. What\u2019s your competitive advantage? Competitive advantage over other DeFi solutions: validated product-market-fit existing non-speculative target user base clear monetisation model Competitive advantage over fintech solutions and traditional banking: No bank account required DeFi integrations provide for a continuous above-market* savings rate with perfect liquidity No need for long-term lockups to receive interest - continuous interest payment Resistance to fraud or manipulation Provable solvency - no surprise bankruptcies or not being able to access one\u2019s funds Ability to receive funds even if the organization dissolves or fails Scaling potential to co-operative bank model User incentives to grow the network Transparent, real-time, immutable financial record-keeping for every user \u2013 solving fraud and minimizing the misuse of funds through multi-signature fund deployment Easy integration of new financial products due to ethereum interoperability What does the world look like if Akropolis is a success? Unraidable member-owned \u201cpension funds\u201d vs. a state unilaterally raiding public pension funds, like what happened in Argentina, Poland, Venezuela Provably solvent at all times due to transparent and fully auditable smart-contracts vs. a multi-billion-dollar GE pension scheme that is deemed both \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and \u201cimpossible to unravel\u201d Source of social insurance and support vs. reliance on an opaque centralised party What 100x improvement over the status quo do you enable? Imagine, you are approaching retirement age and are counting on a healthy amount to see you through your latter years? Only to discover that after fees, haircuts and forced reductions, the money you were counting on is not there? Because your country is massively in debt and the public funds have been leveraged to pay other debts of the state. And you are not prepared? Having an alternative system that renders such outcome an impossibility by design is an \u221ex improvement to what is expected to be a status quo for many people on a 10-year timeframe. What are informal savings groups (ISG)? Why are they important? Savings groups are member-owned institutions, typically <20 members who save together and take small loans from the common savings pool or invest together and then share profits. Savings Groups are simple, transparent, autonomous and locally run . Members provide their own savings and credit services at negligible cost, while retaining earnings and investment in their own communities. Savings groups have proven to be one of the most effective, low-cost alternative mechanisms to provide basic financial services for people that have difficulties in receiving those services from traditional financial institutions. Informal savings groups and closely linked to diaspora remittances and are an existing element of most emerging markets economies. They are one of the earliest and most robust surviving forms of a de facto autonomous financial organisation. What are autonomous financial organisations (AFO)? Autonomous financial organisations is a term native to the Akropolis protocol used to denote all digital co-ops/guilds, i.e. member-owned organisations that provide financial services such as co-savings and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, a basic form of insurance etc. Informal Savings Groups is a real-world form of an AFO. What services are planned to be available for AFOs? Savings accounts, co-investment inside the network, access to low-cost easily accessible credit inside the network, social insurance. Why focus on emerging markets? Real-world use case : mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will first take place in areas with poorly developed legacy financial infrastructure, where cryptocurrency adds real value and is a superior alternative to currently available options. Weak legacy financial infrastructure : dominance of mobile money (e.g. mPesa) for over a decade; relatively advanced digital financial infrastructure. Multi-billion-dollar total addressable market : Informal savings groups hold hundreds of billions of US$, with remittances between diaspora/immigrant communities reaching US$240 bn YoY . Existing behavioural patterns and product-market fit : Without imposing new behavioural patterns on users who have already been operating like this for years, we help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks by making them scaleable, fraud-proof, and geography-agnostic using the blockchain technology. We see informal economy in Africa, esp. Kenya as an excellent market to verify assumptions and get real user feedback that will help the protocol evolve into a tool for developed markets based on our 10-year outlook (failure of centralised pension funds, failure of depositor protection schemes, cash controls, etc.), which if correct will spawn a new wave of digital member-owned financial organisations as safer, more trustworthy alternatives. Why adopt blockchain technology? Two of our target networks have already decided that they need to move to a blockchain-first infrastructure from their legacy infrastructure which is now >10 years old. The advantages they see is low OpEx, low cost of remittances, resilience to fraud and manipulation, and ability to scale their businesses. On a more general note, a stable financial system relies on trust in the state and private sector financial institutions. In most developed markets, that trust has been lost. In our use case, blockchain technology uniquely enables alternative member-owned financial institutions by providing the following: trust-minimised exchange of value between the parties that do not know or trust each other shared immutable on-chain financial accounting prevents fraud and misuse of funds fully transparent and auditable smart contracts ensure provable solvency. For more details, please see our Wiki FAQ Please elaborate on your token economy? MakerDAO and Livepeer as reference models. For more details, please see our Wiki FAQ . What\u2019s the necessity for token issuing? A native AKRO token is required to enable fiscal governance of the internal network economy and solve for trust in cases of credit issuance between network members. Token issuance is required to ensure wide initial distribution of the token. For more details, please see our Tokenomics Wiki Page . Why not use stablecoin instead of your token? Our protocol has an internal economy. Governance of the internal economy requires an internal token. The token staking and governance approach requires a token whose value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects and networks. As such, the AKRO token is an essential element of the protocol internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin. Our team will continue improving the model through collaboration with the largest blockchain research centre in Europe, University College London, and their token economics research programme, detailed here . Technology Why is there a need to use blockchain and what does it uniquely enable that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible? A stable financial system relies on trust in the state and private sector financial institutions. In most developed markets, that trust has been lost. Blockchain technology uniquely enables alternative member-owned financial institutions by providing the following: trust-minimised exchange of value between the parties that do not know or trust each other shared immutable on-chain financial accounting prevents fraud and misuse of funds fully transparent and auditable smart contracts ensure provable solvency. Will you be building your own blockchain? No, we are not. Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using Polkadot , with active R&D underway. What is the risk of your solution being affected by Ethereum scalability issues? At the protocol level, speed and immediately finality are not as relevant as being able to guarantee fraud-resistant accounting and solve for trust-minimised exchanges of value between remote parties. Therefore, scalability is not a critical dependency on our roadmap. What are the building blocks of Akropolis protocol? C2FC AFO maintenance and Governance Module Identity Management module Accounting module Network Governance module What is C2FC? Commitments to Future Cashflows (or C2FC) \u2013 a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. What is AFO maintenance and Governance Module? AFOs work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from a protocol governance as only AFO members are able to make decisions thus there is no need for the internal token in every autonomous financial organisation. AFO maintenance and Governance Module provides decision support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. What is Identity Management Module (IM)? IMS is analogous to Ethereum Naming service, which keep the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link List of all created AFOs List of all created AFO members Do you provide a credit scoring system? No. We do not centrally store protocol user data or provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. Any third-party can access pseudo-anonymised transactions on-chain and assess the risk on their own or use third-party data to assess the risk. Off-chain information may be elected to be shared by AFOs in order to get access to competitively-priced credit from external capital providers. As a result, a third-party may combine various opt-in data sources to create an alternative credit scoring system. When Ethereum anonymisation and gas-effective zk-snarks solution is created, we will seek to apply it to the protocol. We continue monitoring the ecosystem, e.g. Aztec protocol.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#what-is-akropolis","text":"Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy.

Our scheme is generalised to allow any cryptocurrency to be used with any identifier. We bring simplicity and familiar UX to crypto by allowing people to send and receive crypto (Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, at this stage!) using just their mobile number All you need to send crypto to a friend is her mobile number No need to share your ethereum address over insecure channels like messengers/email/SMS. It\u2019s quick, as easy as Venmo , safe and private (you hold the keys) Problem In order to make a payment over a decentralized network, the user needs to know the recipient\u2019s public key. A public key is a notoriously long set of numbers and letters. It is easy to make a mistake, and copy-pasting isn\u2019t always safe if your device is compromised. As a result, the UX is not intuitive and continues to present a serious hurdle to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. There are notable teams working on addressing that - shoutout to Austin Griffith from BurnerWallet , Ric from Balance.io and Viktor from TrustWallet . What we are proposing below is our solution that can be integrated with the ecosystem wallets, exchanges and dApps to expand their offering and UX. Solution We introduce a NuCypher-based cryptographic scheme, which allows users to send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to a mobile number instead of the recipient\u2019s public key. Our solution has the following features: Convenient and familiar UX : no cognitive burden on users User privacy and self-sovereignty : user controls who can know her Ethereum address. User can only receive payments from pre-approved parties, however their number is uncapped. Generalised and scalable : can be used across many identifiers and any cryptocurrencies any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. How it works Register Set settings of access to ethereum address to your friends from the contact list Send tokens and ethereum using a phone number instead of ethereum address. Target Client Base (lib) Wallets and dApp browsers ( Trust wallet , Balance , imToken , etc.) Exchanges ( Binance , Coinbase , Kraken , etc.) dApps ( OpenSea , CryptoKitties , Decentraland , etc.). Tech design A) Database: (KMS-like (Key Management System), could be centralized or decentralized): stores a pair of phone number\u2019s hash and NuCypher public key. B) Storage (could be centralized or decentralized): keeps users' encrypted messages with private information: ethereum address, first name and last name (or nickname). Let\u2019s consider our usual Bob and Alice. 1) When registering Alice performs the following actions: a. encrypts the data (message w/ ethereum address, first name/last name) with its private key and puts it in Storage b. sends its NuCypher public key to Database. 2) Alice sends API request to Database and gets Bob's NuCypher public key. 3) Alice creates a re-encryption key (rekey) >> NuCypher nodes re-encrypt Alice\u2019s data >> Alice puts TreasureMap in Storage. Now Bob can decipher Alice\u2019s data by his private NuCypher key. Please note that actions 2 and 3 can be performed for any number of friends from Alice\u2019s contact list. Then Bob wants to send ETH or ERC-20 tokens to Alice. 4) Bob gets TreasureMap from Storage. 5) Bob deciphers Alice\u2019s data. Now Bob knows Alice\u2019s ethereum address. 6) The application generates a transaction for Alice with the ethereum address from the message as a payee. Thus, users can send each other ETH/ERC-20 using just a mobile number of any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. Why NuCypher NuCypher is a decentralized KMS provider based on homomorphic cryptography. Using NuCypher we can achieve a secure transmission of address data and effect transfers between the two parties without disclosing the addresses themselves, thus delivering robust partial anonymisation of transactions. A complete anonymisation can be achieved using ZK-Snarks, Schnorr signatures or ring signatures however this work is outside of the timeframe allowed for this project and may be included in further iterations. As a result, what we get is cryptographically secure solution that guarantees that access to address and phone number data cannot be obtained illegally or on authorities\u2019 demand without the explicit consent of the user.

Findings from the commission\u200a \u2014 \u200aestablished last December by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Institute of Directors\u200a \u2014 \u200asuggested the government had used artificially high discount rates to report unfunded liabilities and a different rate to calculate employer and employee contributions, which appeared to lower the cost of providing public sector pensions. (See earlier IPE article: UK roundup: ONS and Public Sector Pensions Commission ) The report said the government employed a discount rate based on AA-rated corporate bonds instead of index-linked gilts to calculate liabilities, while public sector employers and employees are \"not charged the full current service costs of the liabilities the pension schemes are taking on each year\". It said a \"completely different discount rate\" chosen by the government had been used to compute these. As a result, the commission argued that both employers and employees undervalue the scheme because although they are paying combined contributions of around 20% of salary, the true value based on index-linked gilts is closer to 40% of salary, or even 30% based on long-term gilt returns. It estimated that, in 2010\u201311, using the government's methodology for calculating the annual service cost, these pensions would cost \u00a318.5bn (\u20ac22.2bn), of which \u00a34.5bn would come from the Treasury, or the taxpayer. But the commission said this was an inaccurate measure of the cost, that the figure was closer to \u00a335bn a year and that this is what employers and employees should be paying. Peter Tompkins, fellow of the institute of actuaries and chairman of the commission, said: \"It is a matter both of justice and good economics that public sector employees and employers should bear the full cost of their pension provision as it accrues. \"So long as those contributions are sufficient to pay the public sector pensions of today, the cash flows in and out steadily and in balance. \"Of late, however, the amount the Treasury has to pay to top pensions up has risen and will rise still further into the future. \"Like an unstable Ponzi scheme, it will only work if tomorrow's generations of new members and taxpayers are able to stomach a higher cost to pay tomorrow for the unfunded promises being made today.\" Tompkins added: \"No one change on its own will be enough to control costs if you want to bring costs down to the 20% level people have in mind, rather than a 40% we believe we have shown they are actually costing.\" The commission outlined a number of potential reforms to try and improve transparency and reduce the cost of the public sector pensions to the taxpayer, such as: A reformed defined benefit option to bring costs down to 20% of salary Reducing the accrual rate to 1/80th or switching to a career average scheme could save \u00a310bn a year Increasing pension age to 65 for all members, which would save \u00a35bn a year Reducing index-linking of pensions from Retail Price Inflation (RPI) to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which would save 10% of the costs Increasing employer contributions by 2 percentage points, raising \u00a32bn a year Other possibilities considered by the commission included moving to a defined contribution or a hybrid scheme, although the report noted each option for reform had its pros and cons.

Findings from the commission\u200a \u2014 \u200aestablished last December by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Institute of Directors\u200a \u2014 \u200asuggested the government had used artificially high discount rates to report unfunded liabilities and a different rate to calculate employer and employee contributions, which appeared to lower the cost of providing public sector pensions. (See earlier IPE article: UK roundup: ONS and Public Sector Pensions Commission ) The report said the government employed a discount rate based on AA-rated corporate bonds instead of index-linked gilts to calculate liabilities, while public sector employers and employees are \"not charged the full current service costs of the liabilities the pension schemes are taking on each year\". It said a \"completely different discount rate\" chosen by the government had been used to compute these. As a result, the commission argued that both employers and employees undervalue the scheme because although they are paying combined contributions of around 20% of salary, the true value based on index-linked gilts is closer to 40% of salary, or even 30% based on long-term gilt returns. It estimated that, in 2010\u201311, using the government's methodology for calculating the annual service cost, these pensions would cost \u00a318.5bn (\u20ac22.2bn), of which \u00a34.5bn would come from the Treasury, or the taxpayer. But the commission said this was an inaccurate measure of the cost, that the figure was closer to \u00a335bn a year and that this is what employers and employees should be paying. Peter Tompkins, fellow of the institute of actuaries and chairman of the commission, said: \"It is a matter both of justice and good economics that public sector employees and employers should bear the full cost of their pension provision as it accrues. \"So long as those contributions are sufficient to pay the public sector pensions of today, the cash flows in and out steadily and in balance. \"Of late, however, the amount the Treasury has to pay to top pensions up has risen and will rise still further into the future. \"Like an unstable Ponzi scheme, it will only work if tomorrow's generations of new members and taxpayers are able to stomach a higher cost to pay tomorrow for the unfunded promises being made today.\" Tompkins added: \"No one change on its own will be enough to control costs if you want to bring costs down to the 20% level people have in mind, rather than a 40% we believe we have shown they are actually costing.\" The commission outlined a number of potential reforms to try and improve transparency and reduce the cost of the public sector pensions to the taxpayer, such as: A reformed defined benefit option to bring costs down to 20% of salary Reducing the accrual rate to 1/80th or switching to a career average scheme could save \u00a310bn a year Increasing pension age to 65 for all members, which would save \u00a35bn a year Reducing index-linking of pensions from Retail Price Inflation (RPI) to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which would save 10% of the costs Increasing employer contributions by 2 percentage points, raising \u00a32bn a year Other possibilities considered by the commission included moving to a defined contribution or a hybrid scheme, although the report noted each option for reform had its pros and cons. Tompkins added: \"As Greece has been experiencing, increases to retirement ages or cuts in benefits are not popular at the best of times, but implementing them as part of a package of crisis cuts is the least palatable option of all. \"It is essential reforms be conducted early in a measured way rather than waiting until we have a crisis.\" Tompkins repeatedly said he believed existing benefits should be \"sacrosanct\".

The internet began implementation in 1983. The first smartphone was launched in 1992\u201315 years before the first iPhone drove us all into a frenzy. Following slow starts, these innovations became 'disruptive technologies' that fundamentally changed all aspects of the world around us, including within the pensions industry. And now another emerging technology is expected to have just as much of an impact: Blockchain. About blockchain Blockchain is a \"game changer\" according to Protiviti managing director, IT security and privacy, Ryan Rubin.\"A disruptive technology that fundamentally calls into question many of the industry structures that have been in place for decades, if not centuries.\" Blockchain technology is a new way to process financial transactions. While traditionally these transactions required the use of 'middlemen' to verify the transaction securely (custodian houses and the London Stock Exchange are two such 'middlemen' for example), blockchain removes the need for these intermediaries. The result is transactions can be completed more swiftly and with less 'processes' to go through, which can therefore lower costs. To achieve this, the digital record of a financial transaction is encrypted into a 'block'. A number of blockchain users' computers (as independent entities known as 'blockchain miners') then verify if it is a genuine transaction. If they all approve the transaction the money will be passed from A to B. The 'block' representing that transaction is then bound onto the 'chain' that records the movement of that money using algorithms\u200a\u2014\u200athus creating a continuous, linked list of transactions that provides a secure and unchangeable history of electronic transactions, Equiniti director Paul Sturgess says. Or, to put it simply, EY director Jason Whyte compares it to the old mobile phone game Snake , where every time the snake 'ate' a block on screen, the block got added onto the end of the snake. The details of each transaction/ block are not stored, only the fact that the transaction happened, along with the unique 'digital signature' of that transaction/block, which cannot be converted back into its original form. \"If the original data was altered it would produce a different digital signature that would alert the network to the mismatch,\" Gowling director Liz Wood explains. To put a visual slant on it, imagine someone holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves etc\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block has this 'picture' of all the previous transactions, and the further along the chain, the more repetitions of the 'picture' each block would have. Therefore any tampering would stand out throughout the chain. Also, as the data is distributed to so many computers, it should be much harder for hackers to attack it compared to traditional financial transaction processes. Blockchain's use of multiple peer devices to authorise every transaction means \"it quite simply can't be overridden by one party attempting to manipulate records\", Hames states. Adding to the blockchain's security is the element of tracking and transparency. As there are no 'middlemen' recording the movement of money, the blockchains showing the financial transactions are instead available for everybody to view, via a distributed (or 'shared') ledger. IFDS director of innovation Phil Goffin adds that blockchain provides both investors and financial institutions with the same industry-standard cryptography controls to enable secure communications. This removes trust issues such as identity theft, thus enabling parties to maintain shared ledgers of their economic affairs, he explains. Financial beginnings Blockchain technology was first conceived in 2008 and was implemented in 2009 to be used with the online-only currency (which is a currency that has no gold or silver standard attached to it, no government backing, and is only worth as much as people are prepared to trade for it, also known as a 'cryptocurrency') Bitcoin. So far, the amount of money moved using blockchain amounts to just 0.025 per cent of global GDP, or $20 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. But while the amount is currently small, this is set to grow rapidly, particularly as the financial services industry has started to explore blockchain's potential. There are currently a number of blockchain trials taking place within the financial service industry, such as R3 Cev, which is a consortium of over 40 banks developing the settlement of securities using blockchain and setl.io, a group that is developing an institutional payment solution for the UK banking system. The Bank of England is also leading a trial to replace the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which sits at the heart of the UK banking system. Also, the Financial Conduct Authority said that it was considering approving a \"small but significant number of firms\", Alpha FMC principal Olivia Vinden says. \"A group of seven banks, including Santander, CIBC and UniCredit were amongst the first financial institutions to move real money across borders using blockchain-based technology,\" she adds. Financial services firms embracing this technology may seem strange, as it has the potential to be an existential risk to entire sections within the industry. \"For some financial companies, blockchain strikes at the heart of your business, if your business model is in managing those assets for people who want to trade them,\" Whyte says. \"But then the question is if you think this is going to cannibalise your industry, are you better to cannibalise it first and build a new business model around it or wait for it to happen to you?\" Vinden agrees that blockchain could represent a risk to those parts of the financial industry that support clearing, settlement and safekeeping. \"However, the possibility to reduce costs as a result of this technology should be seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat,\" she states. For instance, Capita divisional head of marketing and research Robin Hames thinks it could quite easily take off in emerging economies where the financial infrastructure is less developed and less ingrained, so can more easily be overhauled. \"It's the 'advanced' economies themselves in catch up, ironically,\" he adds. Asset management is expected to be the first aspect of the financial services sector to take this opportunity and implement blockchain. Alternative assets in particular are normally quite illiquid, but blockchain could help turn them into more tradeable assets, Whyte predicts. Pensions' explorations So it is not surprising that the financial services sector is among the first to see if the benefits of blockchain can be utilised beyond the movement of online currencies. But what may be more surprising is that its potential within pensions is already being explored. Dutch pensions manager APG recently announced that it has earmarked a significant part of its innovation budget for the coming years for working alongside other companies to explore the practical applications of blockchain. The California Public Employees' Retirement Systems (CalPERS), the largest public pension fund in the US, has also discussed the possibility of investing in blockchain technology, while reports have emerged that the Chinese government will soon start using blockchain technology to process social security payments. Even the UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is in the process of a three- to six-month blockchain trial, which began in May this year, with up to 24 participants. This is conducted by a private sector company, that handles the claimant's data independently from government. \"This is a small scale, voluntary trial. There are no restrictions or limits on how welfare payments are spent for those involved in the trial and all personal information is removed before the data reaches DWP,\" its spokesperson states. Industry uses Within the pensions industry itself, people are beginning to consider the benefits blockchain could provide. According to BTL Group founder and CEO Guy Halford-Thompson, \"for industries, such as pensions, which have suffered from a lack of transparency in the past, there is a huge opportunity to transform the industry with a small amount of investment in blockchain technology\". State Street head of UK pensions and banks, asset owner solutions, Andy Todd thinks it will initially impact the most 'inefficient' areas of the pensions industry, such as those that are manual, require a lot of stakeholders to engage, align and sign-off, or have intermediaries that add cost to the system. Certainly smoothing the many layers within the pensions industry generally could be beneficial to savers. Currently, the pension fund member is connected to a set of underlying assets via pension fund managers, asset managers, brokers and investment funds. Blockchain technology offers the prospect of sweeping away a lot of this complexity and frictional cost, Rubin says. \"For example, how long does it currently take the industry to undertake a pension fund transfer? Typically several months. To a customer who is already getting used to the fact that they can transfer money reliably between bank accounts now in a matter of minutes via Faster Payments, the length of this delay is difficult for the industry to explain. Blockchain technology could bring this time down to a matter of minutes if implemented correctly,\" he explains. The greater transparency of ownership of pension fund assets could make well-performing funds more attractive to buyers, therefore helping generate better investment decisions overall, Rubin adds. Blockchain technology could also instigate the use of 'smart contracts', where the technology has rules built in to automate simple transactions when certain conditions are met (such as a market fluctuation or a pension saver reaching a certain age). This would offer greater transparency on payments/fees/ allocation of funds and shorten the time taken to complete transactions. Blockchain's ability to 'link' financial transactions together could also be a valuable mechanism for recording an individual's pension savings. \"Instead of having a new pension every time I go to a new employer, the record of my pension and the contributions paid in may be added to my one blockchain, despite the different employers throughout my working life paying into my pension. And as it cannot be modified, we will always know that it is an accurate record,\" Whyte says. Blockchain could then also have a role in the secondary annuity market where initial and ultimate beneficiaries will change over time, Sturgess adds. It is important to note that blockchain technology has the potential for recording and linking any data, not just financial, meaning its uses within the pensions industry could extend beyond finance to administration. For instance, blockchain could be used to improve upon pensions communications. If a member had several pots with various providers, that information could be pooled into a blockchain so as to form an overall position of the member's pensions savings, Wood states. The industry is currently in the process of implementing a pensions dashboard to enable people to see all their savings in one place, so it would not be surprising if this area was an early adopter of blockchain within the pensions industry, Hames adds. Documents such as member records, scheme documents, service contracts and accounts could be kept and updated through blockchain. All parties would be able to view the same information, so the problem of version control would disappear, Pensions Administration Standards Association chairman Margaret Snowdon says. Blockchain may become a powerful weapon against pension liberation fraud, due to the increased transparency it provides. Data could also be included within the blockchain to confirm whether advice has been taken before the money is transferred to the saver, Snowdon adds. \"From a financial advice perspective it would be great to be able to hand over an accurate record of a pensions holdings and have a financial adviser view that blockchain very rapidly to get a view of what they have got and might need,\" Whyte says. He adds that \"you can imagine the government being quite interested in blockchain for tax records\". Hames agrees that it would be \"tremendously useful\" for regulators and auditors who struggle with reconciliation activities, which could be done automatically. \"A very prescient example would be the current GMP reconciliation requirements, which will exorcise the minds and time of administrators and trustees alike for the next couple of years,\" he says. \"Imagine how less painful, or frankly unnecessary, this work would be had a shared, validated ledger existed.\" Risks So already the industry is imagining blockchain technology having a wide number of benefits for the sector. Imagination is a wonderful thing. But could the reality be not so pretty? Despite blockchain still being a new technology, and the security it provides much heralded, it has already been subject to hacks. For instance, recent attacks on digital currency exchanges DAO and Bitfinex saw over $50 million taken. Re Business Blockchain author William Mougayar states that while security is an inherent feature of blockchains, a blockchain application could be badly written and have security holes, \"just as a web application could have security weaknesses too\". Breaches so far seem to be exploiting the trouble users have protecting their online currency (as they are generally stored in digital files) instead of the distributed ledger system of blockchains itself being compromised. But the whole 'newness' of the technology could also be an issue. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is a group of US regulators, has already warned that \"operational vulnerabilities [with blockchain] may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale\". A teething problem that has already occurred, Whyte notes, is when two transactions happen at roughly the same time, which can result in a short period of time where a blockchain has two chains until the 'real' chain is established. Another issue is that the technology is changing very quickly. For instance, Accenture has just taken out a controversial patent on a technology that lets them edit a blockchain. A key part of blockchain's security is that it cannot be tampered with, but the argument for this patent is that it would provide a cleaner way to undo a mistake, such as if someone made a 'fat finger trade' and added an extra '0' onto a transaction, Whyte explains. The evolving nature of the new technology also generates a risk around standardisation and cooperation. \"As the technology is still evolving it is possible that we could end up with a VHS versus Betamax situation,\" Sturgess warns, \"where both technologies were technically excellent for the purpose, but ultimately it was disagreement regarding standards and licenses that allowed VHS to dominate the market.\" Reluctance There is also a risk that the pensions industry itself may be reluctant to utilise blockchain technology. As is often the case with technology advances, legacy systems are the biggest barrier to implementation. It really required online banking to take hold before many in pensions were prepared to embrace the digital channel, Hames states. \"And let's be honest, there are still plenty of schemes that are well behind the online curve, let alone exploring blockchain,\" he adds. To counter this, Snowdon recommends the creation of a technology forum for the pensions industry. But in the meantime, it seems unlikely the pensions industry would want to risk putting pension fund members savings in cutting-edge technology. While the technology is still being developed and is not yet being widely used by banks, a court may not look favourably on a trustee who invested in a company using blockchain if this resulted in the loss of pension scheme money, Wood warns. And while blockchain may have benefits for the pensions sector, and could reduce some inefficiency, it will not be a panacea to all the industry's problems. For instance, it will not provide insight as to where money should be invested to achieve positive returns with low volatility. It will not stop human error, such the wrong amounts being put into the system. And it will not address the need for people save more for retirement and engage with those savings. Overhype? So as it is certainly not a 'cure all', does that mean blockchain technology is overhyped? \"It is approaching the peak of Gartner's Hype Curve,\" Sturgess states, \"and as such will soon drop into the wonderfully-named 'trough of disillusionment', at which point many early-stage companies are likely to fail and the market will become frustrated by the lack of useable products and tangible benefits. The technology companies will then start to consolidate and prepare for mainstream adoption as clearer business use cases start to emerge.\" It has to be remembered that the technology is still very new. Currently, blockchain is being compared to the internet in the 1990s, where the first internet sites looked and behaved more like traditional shops until people became used to the new technology and its applications. As it still early days for the technology, no doubt blockchain will see a number of false starts. But when considering if and when blockchain will have an impact on the pension sector, it is worth mulling over the words of a man at the heart of many technological innovations\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Gates. He has stated: \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10.

Or, to put it simply, EY director Jason Whyte compares it to the old mobile phone game Snake , where every time the snake 'ate' a block on screen, the block got added onto the end of the snake. The details of each transaction/ block are not stored, only the fact that the transaction happened, along with the unique 'digital signature' of that transaction/block, which cannot be converted back into its original form. \"If the original data was altered it would produce a different digital signature that would alert the network to the mismatch,\" Gowling director Liz Wood explains. To put a visual slant on it, imagine someone holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves etc\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block has this 'picture' of all the previous transactions, and the further along the chain, the more repetitions of the 'picture' each block would have. Therefore any tampering would stand out throughout the chain. Also, as the data is distributed to so many computers, it should be much harder for hackers to attack it compared to traditional financial transaction processes. Blockchain's use of multiple peer devices to authorise every transaction means \"it quite simply can't be overridden by one party attempting to manipulate records\", Hames states. Adding to the blockchain's security is the element of tracking and transparency. As there are no 'middlemen' recording the movement of money, the blockchains showing the financial transactions are instead available for everybody to view, via a distributed (or 'shared') ledger. IFDS director of innovation Phil Goffin adds that blockchain provides both investors and financial institutions with the same industry-standard cryptography controls to enable secure communications. This removes trust issues such as identity theft, thus enabling parties to maintain shared ledgers of their economic affairs, he explains.","title":"About blockchain"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#financial-beginnings","text":"Blockchain technology was first conceived in 2008 and was implemented in 2009 to be used with the online-only currency (which is a currency that has no gold or silver standard attached to it, no government backing, and is only worth as much as people are prepared to trade for it, also known as a 'cryptocurrency') Bitcoin. So far, the amount of money moved using blockchain amounts to just 0.025 per cent of global GDP, or $20 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. But while the amount is currently small, this is set to grow rapidly, particularly as the financial services industry has started to explore blockchain's potential. There are currently a number of blockchain trials taking place within the financial service industry, such as R3 Cev, which is a consortium of over 40 banks developing the settlement of securities using blockchain and setl.io, a group that is developing an institutional payment solution for the UK banking system. The Bank of England is also leading a trial to replace the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which sits at the heart of the UK banking system. Also, the Financial Conduct Authority said that it was considering approving a \"small but significant number of firms\", Alpha FMC principal Olivia Vinden says. \"A group of seven banks, including Santander, CIBC and UniCredit were amongst the first financial institutions to move real money across borders using blockchain-based technology,\" she adds. Financial services firms embracing this technology may seem strange, as it has the potential to be an existential risk to entire sections within the industry. \"For some financial companies, blockchain strikes at the heart of your business, if your business model is in managing those assets for people who want to trade them,\" Whyte says. \"But then the question is if you think this is going to cannibalise your industry, are you better to cannibalise it first and build a new business model around it or wait for it to happen to you?\" Vinden agrees that blockchain could represent a risk to those parts of the financial industry that support clearing, settlement and safekeeping. \"However, the possibility to reduce costs as a result of this technology should be seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat,\" she states. For instance, Capita divisional head of marketing and research Robin Hames thinks it could quite easily take off in emerging economies where the financial infrastructure is less developed and less ingrained, so can more easily be overhauled. \"It's the 'advanced' economies themselves in catch up, ironically,\" he adds. Asset management is expected to be the first aspect of the financial services sector to take this opportunity and implement blockchain. Alternative assets in particular are normally quite illiquid, but blockchain could help turn them into more tradeable assets, Whyte predicts.","title":"Financial beginnings"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#pensions-explorations","text":"So it is not surprising that the financial services sector is among the first to see if the benefits of blockchain can be utilised beyond the movement of online currencies. But what may be more surprising is that its potential within pensions is already being explored. Dutch pensions manager APG recently announced that it has earmarked a significant part of its innovation budget for the coming years for working alongside other companies to explore the practical applications of blockchain. The California Public Employees' Retirement Systems (CalPERS), the largest public pension fund in the US, has also discussed the possibility of investing in blockchain technology, while reports have emerged that the Chinese government will soon start using blockchain technology to process social security payments. Even the UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is in the process of a three- to six-month blockchain trial, which began in May this year, with up to 24 participants. This is conducted by a private sector company, that handles the claimant's data independently from government. \"This is a small scale, voluntary trial. There are no restrictions or limits on how welfare payments are spent for those involved in the trial and all personal information is removed before the data reaches DWP,\" its spokesperson states.","title":"Pensions&#39; explorations"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#industry-uses","text":"Within the pensions industry itself, people are beginning to consider the benefits blockchain could provide. According to BTL Group founder and CEO Guy Halford-Thompson, \"for industries, such as pensions, which have suffered from a lack of transparency in the past, there is a huge opportunity to transform the industry with a small amount of investment in blockchain technology\". State Street head of UK pensions and banks, asset owner solutions, Andy Todd thinks it will initially impact the most 'inefficient' areas of the pensions industry, such as those that are manual, require a lot of stakeholders to engage, align and sign-off, or have intermediaries that add cost to the system. Certainly smoothing the many layers within the pensions industry generally could be beneficial to savers. Currently, the pension fund member is connected to a set of underlying assets via pension fund managers, asset managers, brokers and investment funds. Blockchain technology offers the prospect of sweeping away a lot of this complexity and frictional cost, Rubin says. \"For example, how long does it currently take the industry to undertake a pension fund transfer? Typically several months. To a customer who is already getting used to the fact that they can transfer money reliably between bank accounts now in a matter of minutes via Faster Payments, the length of this delay is difficult for the industry to explain. Blockchain technology could bring this time down to a matter of minutes if implemented correctly,\" he explains. The greater transparency of ownership of pension fund assets could make well-performing funds more attractive to buyers, therefore helping generate better investment decisions overall, Rubin adds. Blockchain technology could also instigate the use of 'smart contracts', where the technology has rules built in to automate simple transactions when certain conditions are met (such as a market fluctuation or a pension saver reaching a certain age). This would offer greater transparency on payments/fees/ allocation of funds and shorten the time taken to complete transactions. Blockchain's ability to 'link' financial transactions together could also be a valuable mechanism for recording an individual's pension savings. \"Instead of having a new pension every time I go to a new employer, the record of my pension and the contributions paid in may be added to my one blockchain, despite the different employers throughout my working life paying into my pension. And as it cannot be modified, we will always know that it is an accurate record,\" Whyte says. Blockchain could then also have a role in the secondary annuity market where initial and ultimate beneficiaries will change over time, Sturgess adds. It is important to note that blockchain technology has the potential for recording and linking any data, not just financial, meaning its uses within the pensions industry could extend beyond finance to administration. For instance, blockchain could be used to improve upon pensions communications. If a member had several pots with various providers, that information could be pooled into a blockchain so as to form an overall position of the member's pensions savings, Wood states. The industry is currently in the process of implementing a pensions dashboard to enable people to see all their savings in one place, so it would not be surprising if this area was an early adopter of blockchain within the pensions industry, Hames adds. Documents such as member records, scheme documents, service contracts and accounts could be kept and updated through blockchain. All parties would be able to view the same information, so the problem of version control would disappear, Pensions Administration Standards Association chairman Margaret Snowdon says. Blockchain may become a powerful weapon against pension liberation fraud, due to the increased transparency it provides. Data could also be included within the blockchain to confirm whether advice has been taken before the money is transferred to the saver, Snowdon adds. \"From a financial advice perspective it would be great to be able to hand over an accurate record of a pensions holdings and have a financial adviser view that blockchain very rapidly to get a view of what they have got and might need,\" Whyte says. He adds that \"you can imagine the government being quite interested in blockchain for tax records\". Hames agrees that it would be \"tremendously useful\" for regulators and auditors who struggle with reconciliation activities, which could be done automatically. \"A very prescient example would be the current GMP reconciliation requirements, which will exorcise the minds and time of administrators and trustees alike for the next couple of years,\" he says. \"Imagine how less painful, or frankly unnecessary, this work would be had a shared, validated ledger existed.\"","title":"Industry uses"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#risks","text":"So already the industry is imagining blockchain technology having a wide number of benefits for the sector. Imagination is a wonderful thing. But could the reality be not so pretty? Despite blockchain still being a new technology, and the security it provides much heralded, it has already been subject to hacks. For instance, recent attacks on digital currency exchanges DAO and Bitfinex saw over $50 million taken. Re Business Blockchain author William Mougayar states that while security is an inherent feature of blockchains, a blockchain application could be badly written and have security holes, \"just as a web application could have security weaknesses too\". Breaches so far seem to be exploiting the trouble users have protecting their online currency (as they are generally stored in digital files) instead of the distributed ledger system of blockchains itself being compromised. But the whole 'newness' of the technology could also be an issue. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is a group of US regulators, has already warned that \"operational vulnerabilities [with blockchain] may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale\". A teething problem that has already occurred, Whyte notes, is when two transactions happen at roughly the same time, which can result in a short period of time where a blockchain has two chains until the 'real' chain is established. Another issue is that the technology is changing very quickly. For instance, Accenture has just taken out a controversial patent on a technology that lets them edit a blockchain. A key part of blockchain's security is that it cannot be tampered with, but the argument for this patent is that it would provide a cleaner way to undo a mistake, such as if someone made a 'fat finger trade' and added an extra '0' onto a transaction, Whyte explains. The evolving nature of the new technology also generates a risk around standardisation and cooperation. \"As the technology is still evolving it is possible that we could end up with a VHS versus Betamax situation,\" Sturgess warns, \"where both technologies were technically excellent for the purpose, but ultimately it was disagreement regarding standards and licenses that allowed VHS to dominate the market.\"","title":"Risks"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#reluctance","text":"There is also a risk that the pensions industry itself may be reluctant to utilise blockchain technology. As is often the case with technology advances, legacy systems are the biggest barrier to implementation. It really required online banking to take hold before many in pensions were prepared to embrace the digital channel, Hames states. \"And let's be honest, there are still plenty of schemes that are well behind the online curve, let alone exploring blockchain,\" he adds. To counter this, Snowdon recommends the creation of a technology forum for the pensions industry. But in the meantime, it seems unlikely the pensions industry would want to risk putting pension fund members savings in cutting-edge technology. While the technology is still being developed and is not yet being widely used by banks, a court may not look favourably on a trustee who invested in a company using blockchain if this resulted in the loss of pension scheme money, Wood warns. And while blockchain may have benefits for the pensions sector, and could reduce some inefficiency, it will not be a panacea to all the industry's problems. For instance, it will not provide insight as to where money should be invested to achieve positive returns with low volatility. It will not stop human error, such the wrong amounts being put into the system. And it will not address the need for people save more for retirement and engage with those savings.","title":"Reluctance"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#overhype","text":"So as it is certainly not a 'cure all', does that mean blockchain technology is overhyped? \"It is approaching the peak of Gartner's Hype Curve,\" Sturgess states, \"and as such will soon drop into the wonderfully-named 'trough of disillusionment', at which point many early-stage companies are likely to fail and the market will become frustrated by the lack of useable products and tangible benefits. The technology companies will then start to consolidate and prepare for mainstream adoption as clearer business use cases start to emerge.\" It has to be remembered that the technology is still very new. Currently, blockchain is being compared to the internet in the 1990s, where the first internet sites looked and behaved more like traditional shops until people became used to the new technology and its applications. As it still early days for the technology, no doubt blockchain will see a number of false starts. But when considering if and when blockchain will have an impact on the pension sector, it is worth mulling over the words of a man at the heart of many technological innovations\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Gates. He has stated: \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10.

There are 6,000 such schemes, attached to all types of business. Currently 5,000 are in deficit.

Not surprisingly, this study only served to confirm many of the rather alarming trends surrounding public pension ponzi's that we discuss on a regular basis. Starting with a high-level status update, Milliman figures the largest 100 public pensions were roughly just as underfunded on June 30, 2017 as they were on June 30, 2016\u2026 not an encouraging development given that the S&P 500 surged 15% over that same period. This 2017 report is based on information that was reported by the plan sponsors at their last fiscal year ends\u200a\u2014\u200aJune 30, 2016 is the measurement date for most of the plans in our 2017 study. At that time, plan assets were still feeling the effects of market downturns in 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016. Total plan assets as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $3.19 trillion, down from $3.24 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends (generally June 30, 2015). However, market performance since the last fiscal year ends has been strong, and we estimate that aggregate plan assets have jumped to $3.44 trillion as of June 30, 2017. We estimate that the plans experienced a median annualized return on assets of 11.49% in the period between their fiscal year ends and June 30, 2017. The Total Pension Liability reported at the last fiscal year ends totaled $4.72 trillion, up from $4.43 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends. We estimate that the Total Pension Liability has increased to $4.87 trillion as of June 30, 2017. The aggregate underfunding as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $1.53 trillion, but we estimate that the underfunding has narrowed to $1.43 trillion as of June 30, 2017. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Meanwhile, 32% of the top 100 plans were less than 60% funded. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Of course, the discussion gets far more interesting when Milliman analyzes the prevailing discount rates used by public pensions compared to independent analyses of where those discount rates should be set. As our readers are well aware, we've long argued that public pension funds essentially hide their true funding status by simply choosing artificially high discount rates for future liabilities thus making their present values appear lower than they actually are.

This 2017 report is based on information that was reported by the plan sponsors at their last fiscal year ends\u200a\u2014\u200aJune 30, 2016 is the measurement date for most of the plans in our 2017 study. At that time, plan assets were still feeling the effects of market downturns in 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016. Total plan assets as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $3.19 trillion, down from $3.24 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends (generally June 30, 2015). However, market performance since the last fiscal year ends has been strong, and we estimate that aggregate plan assets have jumped to $3.44 trillion as of June 30, 2017. We estimate that the plans experienced a median annualized return on assets of 11.49% in the period between their fiscal year ends and June 30, 2017. The Total Pension Liability reported at the last fiscal year ends totaled $4.72 trillion, up from $4.43 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends. We estimate that the Total Pension Liability has increased to $4.87 trillion as of June 30, 2017. The aggregate underfunding as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $1.53 trillion, but we estimate that the underfunding has narrowed to $1.43 trillion as of June 30, 2017. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Meanwhile, 32% of the top 100 plans were less than 60% funded. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Of course, the discussion gets far more interesting when Milliman analyzes the prevailing discount rates used by public pensions compared to independent analyses of where those discount rates should be set. As our readers are well aware, we've long argued that public pension funds essentially hide their true funding status by simply choosing artificially high discount rates for future liabilities thus making their present values appear lower than they actually are.

The first full generation of workers to retire since this turn offers a sobering preview of a labor force more and more dependent on their own savings for retirement. Years ago, Coomer and his co-workers at the Tulsa plant of McDonnell Douglas, the famed airplane maker, were enrolled in the company pension, but in 1994, with an eye toward cutting retirement costs, the company closed the plant. Now, The Washington Post found in a review of those 998 workers, that even though most of them found new jobs, they could never replace their lost pension benefits and many are facing financial struggles in their old age: 1 in 7 has in their retirement years filed for bankruptcy, faced liens for delinquent bills, or both, according to public records.

They really caught on in the mid-20th century, but today, except among government employers, the traditional pension seems destined to be an artifact of U.S. labor history. The first ones offered by a private company were those handed out by American Express, back when it was a stagecoach delivery service. That was in 1875. The idea didn't exactly spread like wildfire, but under union pressure in the middle of the last century, many companies adopted a plan. By the 1980s, the trend had profoundly reshaped retirement for Americans, with a large majority of full-time workers at medium and large companies getting traditional pension coverage, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Then corporate America changed: Union membership waned. Executive boards, under pressure from financial raiders, focused more intently on maximizing stock prices. And Americans lived longer, making a pension much more expensive to provide. In 1950, a 65-year-old man could be expected to reach age 78, on average. Today, that \u00ad65-year-old is expected to live beyond 84. The extended life expectancy means pension plans must pay out substantially longer than they once did. Exactly what led corporate America away from pensions is a matter of debate among scholars, but there is little question that they seem destined for extinction, at least in the private sector. Even as late as the early 1990s, about 60 percent of full-time workers at medium and large companies had pension coverage, according to the government figures. But today, only about 24 percent of workers at midsize and large companies have pension coverage, according to the data, and that number is expected to continue to fall as older workers exit the workforce. In place of pensions, companies and investment advisers urge employees to open retirement accounts. The basic idea is workers will manage their own retirement funds, sometimes with a little help from their employers, sometimes not. Once they reach retirement age, those accounts are supposed to supplement whatever Social Security might pay. (Today, Social Security provides only enough for a bare-bones budget, about $14,000 a year on average.) The trouble with expecting workers to save on their own is that almost half of U.S. families have no such retirement account, according the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer \u00adFinances. Of those who do have retirement accounts, moreover, their savings are far too scant to support a typical retirement. The median account, among workers at the median income level, is about $25,000. \"The U.S. retirement system, and the workers and retirees it was designed to help, face major challenges,\" according to an October report by the Government Accountability Office. \"Traditional pensions have become much less common, and individuals are increasingly responsible for planning and managing their own retirement savings accounts.\" The GAO further warned that \"many households are ill-equipped for this task and have little or no retirement savings.\" The GAO recommended that Congress consider creating an independent commission to study the U.S. retirement system. \"If no action is taken, a retirement crisis could be looming,\" it said.Coomer makes a pot of coffee at his home in Wagoner after a day of work at Walmart. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he says of working eight-hour shifts with the condition spinal stenosis. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b 'We were stunned' Employees at McDonnell Douglas in the early '90s enjoyed one of the more generous types of pensions, those known as \"30 and out.\" Employees with 30 years on the job could retire with a full pension once they reached age 55. But, as the employees would later learn, the generosity of those pensions made them, in lean times, an appealing target for cost-cutters. Those lean times for McDonnell Douglas began in earnest in the early '90s. Some plants closed. But for the remaining employees, including those at the Tulsa plant, executives said, there was hope: If Congress allowed the multibillion-dollar sale of 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia, the new business would rescue the company. In fact, the company said in its 1991 annual report, it would save 7,000 jobs. To help win approval for the sale, Tulsa employees wrote letters to politicians. They held a rally with local politicians and the governor of Oklahoma. Eventually, in September 1992, President George H.W. Bush approved the sale. It seemed the Tulsa plant had weathered the storm. The headline in the Oklahoman, one of the state's largest newspapers, proclaimed: \"F-15 Sale to Saudi Arabia Saves Jobs of Tulsa Workers.\" But it hadn't. Within months, executives at the company again turned to cost-cutting. They considered closing a plant in Florida, another in Mesa, Ariz., or the Tulsa facility. Tulsa, it was noted, had the oldest hourly employees \u200a\u2014\u200a the average employee was 51 and had worked there for about 20 years. Many were close to getting a full pension, and that meant closing it would yield bigger savings in retirement costs. \"One day in December '93 they came on the loudspeaker and said, 'Attention, employees,' Coomer recalled. \"We were going to close. We were stunned. Just ran around like a bunch of chickens.\" A few years later, McDonnell Douglas, which continued to struggle, merged with Boeing. But the employees had taken their case to court, and in 2001, a federal judge agreed McDonnell Douglas had illegally considered the pensions in its decision to close the plant. The employees' case, presented by attorneys Joe Farris and Mike Mulder, showed the company had tracked pension savings in its plant closure decisions. The judge found McDonnell Douglas, moreover, had offered misleading testimony in its defense of the plant closing. The judge, Sven Erik Holmes, blasted the company for a \"corporate culture of mendacity.\" Employees eventually won settlements\u200a \u2014 \u200aabout $30,000 was typical. It helped carry people over to find new jobs. But the amount was limited to cover the benefits of three years of employment \u200a\u2014 \u200aand it was far less than the loss in pension and retiree health benefits. Because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age, the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility. \"People went to work at these places thinking they'll work there their whole lives,\" Farris said, noting that the pensions held great appeal to the staff. \"Their trust and loyalty, though, was not reciprocated.\"Ray walks through a collection of junk that he recycles at his home in Claremore. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Dreaming of work The economic effects were, of course, immediate. The workers, most of them over 50, had to find jobs. Some enrolled in classes for new skills, but then struggled to find jobs in their new fields. They wondered, amid rejections, whether younger workers were favored. Several found jobs at other industrial plants. One started a chicken farm for Tyson. Another took a job on a ranch breaking horses. The Post acquired a list of the 998 employees, reviewed public records for them and interviewed more than 25. Of those interviewed, all found work of one kind or another. Yet all but a handful said their new wages were only about half of what they had been making. Typically, their pay dropped in half, from about $20 per hour to $10 per hour. The pay cut was tough, and it made saving for retirement close to impossible. In fact, it has made retirement itself near impossible for some\u200a \u2014 \u200athey must work to pay the bills. A few said, though, they work because they detest idleness, and persist in jobs that would seem to require remarkable endurance. Combs, for example, works the graveyard shift, beginning each workday at 1:30 a.m. His days off are Thursday and Sunday. He worked 25 years at McDonnell Douglas, and more than 20 loading trucks. He shrugs off the difficulty. \"I don't want to sit around and play checkers and get fat,\" Combs says. \"I used to pick cotton in 90-degree heat. This is easy.\"Coomer relaxes at home with his wife Ellen after working at Walmart. While he seems to enjoy working at Walmart, Cooomer says he really loved working at McDonnell Douglas and had his eye on his pension during his 29 years there. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Coomer, too, even if he would have preferred to retire, seems to genuinely enjoy his work. At Walmart, his natural cheerfulness is put to good use. \"Hi, Tom, how are you?\" a customer on a motorized scooter, one of many who greet him by name, asks on her way out. \"Doing good . . . beautiful day,\" he says, smiling warmly. Later he explains his geniality. \"I like to talk to people. I like to visit with them. I can talk to anyone. I've always been like that, since I was a kid.\" When he sees someone looking glum, he tells them a joke. Why does Santa Claus have three gardens? So he can hoe, hoe, hoe. \"People really like that one,\" he says. Coomer grew up on a farm in Broken Arrow, got married when he was 17 \u200a\u2014 \u200ahis wife was 15 \u200a\u2014\u200a and says he's always liked work. \"I really loved working at McDonnell Douglas,\" he says. One time, he says, he worked 36 days straight: 11 hours on the weekdays and eight hours on Saturdays and Sundays. He joked the factory was his home address. All along, for his 29 years there, he had his eye on the pension. And then, for the most part, it was gone. After the plant closed, Coomer worked as a security guard. Then he worked for a friend who had a pest-control company. When that slowed down, he picked up seasonal work at the city, doing some mowing and chipping. Then came Walmart. Soon, he said, he expects to cut back from full-time to about three days a week. Along with his Walmart check, he gets $300 a month from the McDonnell Douglas pension. Had he been able to continue working at McDonnell Douglas, he calculates that he would have gotten about five times that amount. \"After they shut the plant down, I would dream that I was back at McDonnell Douglas and going to get my pension,\" Coomer recalled. \"In the dream, I would try to clock in but I couldn't find my time card. And then I'd wake up.\" In the dream, he would have retired years ago.

But the employees had taken their case to court, and in 2001, a federal judge agreed McDonnell Douglas had illegally considered the pensions in its decision to close the plant. The employees' case, presented by attorneys Joe Farris and Mike Mulder, showed the company had tracked pension savings in its plant closure decisions. The judge found McDonnell Douglas, moreover, had offered misleading testimony in its defense of the plant closing. The judge, Sven Erik Holmes, blasted the company for a \"corporate culture of mendacity.\" Employees eventually won settlements\u200a \u2014 \u200aabout $30,000 was typical. It helped carry people over to find new jobs. But the amount was limited to cover the benefits of three years of employment \u200a\u2014 \u200aand it was far less than the loss in pension and retiree health benefits. Because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age, the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility. \"People went to work at these places thinking they'll work there their whole lives,\" Farris said, noting that the pensions held great appeal to the staff. \"Their trust and loyalty, though, was not reciprocated.\"Ray walks through a collection of junk that he recycles at his home in Claremore. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Dreaming of work The economic effects were, of course, immediate. The workers, most of them over 50, had to find jobs. Some enrolled in classes for new skills, but then struggled to find jobs in their new fields. They wondered, amid rejections, whether younger workers were favored. Several found jobs at other industrial plants. One started a chicken farm for Tyson. Another took a job on a ranch breaking horses. The Post acquired a list of the 998 employees, reviewed public records for them and interviewed more than 25. Of those interviewed, all found work of one kind or another. Yet all but a handful said their new wages were only about half of what they had been making. Typically, their pay dropped in half, from about $20 per hour to $10 per hour. The pay cut was tough, and it made saving for retirement close to impossible. In fact, it has made retirement itself near impossible for some\u200a \u2014 \u200athey must work to pay the bills. A few said, though, they work because they detest idleness, and persist in jobs that would seem to require remarkable endurance. Combs, for example, works the graveyard shift, beginning each workday at 1:30 a.m. His days off are Thursday and Sunday. He worked 25 years at McDonnell Douglas, and more than 20 loading trucks. He shrugs off the difficulty. \"I don't want to sit around and play checkers and get fat,\" Combs says. \"I used to pick cotton in 90-degree heat. This is easy.\"Coomer relaxes at home with his wife Ellen after working at Walmart. While he seems to enjoy working at Walmart, Cooomer says he really loved working at McDonnell Douglas and had his eye on his pension during his 29 years there. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Coomer, too, even if he would have preferred to retire, seems to genuinely enjoy his work. At Walmart, his natural cheerfulness is put to good use. \"Hi, Tom, how are you?\" a customer on a motorized scooter, one of many who greet him by name, asks on her way out. \"Doing good . . . beautiful day,\" he says, smiling warmly. Later he explains his geniality. \"I like to talk to people. I like to visit with them. I can talk to anyone. I've always been like that, since I was a kid.\" When he sees someone looking glum, he tells them a joke. Why does Santa Claus have three gardens? So he can hoe, hoe, hoe. \"People really like that one,\" he says. Coomer grew up on a farm in Broken Arrow, got married when he was 17 \u200a\u2014 \u200ahis wife was 15 \u200a\u2014\u200a and says he's always liked work. \"I really loved working at McDonnell Douglas,\" he says. One time, he says, he worked 36 days straight: 11 hours on the weekdays and eight hours on Saturdays and Sundays. He joked the factory was his home address. All along, for his 29 years there, he had his eye on the pension. And then, for the most part, it was gone. After the plant closed, Coomer worked as a security guard. Then he worked for a friend who had a pest-control company. When that slowed down, he picked up seasonal work at the city, doing some mowing and chipping. Then came Walmart. Soon, he said, he expects to cut back from full-time to about three days a week. Along with his Walmart check, he gets $300 a month from the McDonnell Douglas pension. Had he been able to continue working at McDonnell Douglas, he calculates that he would have gotten about five times that amount. \"After they shut the plant down, I would dream that I was back at McDonnell Douglas and going to get my pension,\" Coomer recalled. \"In the dream, I would try to clock in but I couldn't find my time card. And then I'd wake up.\" In the dream, he would have retired years ago.

A blockchain is a data structure. It is like a public digital ledger of all transactions that are shared amongst a network of computers. This chain keeps growing as new transactions and 'blocks' are added to it and when new records are added this creates a linear blockchain. With the help of blockchain the intermediary is no longer needed thus blockchain provides an efficient way for companies to conduct their transactions and verify them without the need for a separate, central authority. Why should the pensions industry adopt blockchain? In 2016 APG, a Dutch asset management company who oversees the biggest pension fund in the Netherlands, announced that it was looking into the possibility of using blockchain in the fields of financial services and logistics. Blockchain offers several advantages that the UK pension industry can also benefit from: Security: Blockchain uses cryptography. This allows each of the participants on the network to the use digital ledger and makes changes in a completely secure way. Therefore, with the help of cryptography, the ledger is public but also safe and trustworthy for clients. Circulation of information: With blockchain the firm that is using it will not need any separate central authority so that the information can be shared with others. Blockchain provides its users with a shared ledger that can be seen and verified by any participant who have been added to that network. Immutability: The meaning of immutability is unchanging. So, blockchain technology has been designed in a way that once the required changes have been, made there can be no tampering or further amendment. This means that the transactions that are added to the records in that public digital ledger are a 100% accurate and cannot be tampered with anyway. This makes blockchain technology not only safe but completely trust worthy and very open to audit and scrutiny by pension administrators and clients alike. The pension industry has to handle multiple financial information and transactions and blockchain could make the management of finances and transactions much easier and simpler. The technology is safe so it is guaranteed that the pensions of clients will not be tampered with and they will receive their pension on time and in full with full transparency of the management of the pension fund. The biggest single advantage of blockchain, compared to older pension technology, is that it is incredibly safe from hackers which make it valuable to the pension industry, or indeed any industry where financial governance and security is a must have. For a hacker to access the public ledger of one network, they would have to hack into every individual computer used in the blockchain, this makes blockchain technology virtually un-hackable. What Microsoft have done with there announcement of Block Chain as a Service (BaaS), hosted on their Azure platform, is to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and its enterprise deployment on Azure. One of its key areas of focus remains middleware integrations \"to make ledgers more approachable for developers and enterprise end users.\" Overall, Microsoft's efforts are directed to ensure that Azure is the preferred way to connect blockchain with the real world. With cybersecurity being a key boardroom issue of concern, is it not time for this modern approach to securing data to be considered a viable option for the pensions industry?

As a result of this ( and some bad luck ), the world's developed economies are over $70 trillion short on their pension obligations. This problem is still fixable. But before you can secure your own post-retirement future or help the world, it's important to understand why future pensioners may have to live in poverty. And to do that, we need to talk about the 3 problems listed above, starting with mismanagement. Mismanagement Most of Europe's large economies\u200a \u2014 \u200a Belgium , France , Germany and others\u200a \u2014 \u200ahave pay as you go pensions . This means collected from workers pays for current pension obligations instead of being saved for the future. This approach has its own downsides , but it does have an advantage. There are no pension funds , so there's nothing to mismanage . This protects EU pensioners from fund managers' mistakes. Of course, some EU countries and many US states have state pension funds. The ones that don't have private-owned ones . Both can be (and often are) mismanaged , losing their beneficiaries' money long before it's needed. Here's an example. Sweden's private pensions system used to let people invest with Maltese-based Falcon Fund . The latter defrauded 22,000 investors of over 2 billion Swedish kroner . That's an instance of fraud , which we'll get to in point 3 \u200a\u2014 \u200abut it couldn't have happened if Sweden's Pension Agency had a better vetting process. And that's mismanagement . Here's another example of mismanagement . In 1999, South Carolina's pension plans were 99% funded . However, the S.C. Retirement System Investment Commission performed so poorly the state's pensions are now $24 billion short . Meanwhile, the top 10 officials in the Investment Commission make an average of about $200,000 ; about 2x more than SC governor Nikki Haley. Scenarios like these are sad, but they're not uncommon. They point to consistent, systemic problems in how the world's economies deal with pensions. And the worst part is that governments and private funds may default on hundreds of millions of pensioners' debt obligations. Here's why. Broken Promises Pension money gets mismanaged often. They often end up short on money, even when fully funded \u200a\u2014\u200a and the issue is systemic. The US has a $4 trillion deficit in pension savings . The developed world as a whole is $78 trillion short. Meanwhile, the Gross World Product is only $78.28 trillion \u2014 \u200ameaning the deficit won't be easy to fix anytime soon.

What's to stop these taxpayers from electing to stop paying for older generations' pensions? You probably know the answer. Nothing. If the burden of pension payments gets too big, nothing stops workers from defaulting on old obligations. So far, most countries have managed to keep their pension systems running smoothly. But with a pension gap that's already comparable to the GDP (and growing), hundreds of millions of people may find themselves with absolutely no post-retirement security .

Virginia's Attorney General is accusing BNY Mellon of defrauding Virginia's pension scheme of $20 million .

In late 2006, Aaron Krowne, a computer scientist and mathematician, started a website that documented the real-time destruction of the subprime mortgage lending industry. The Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter caught on like wildfire with financial market voyeurs, regularly reaching 100,000 visitors. West Coast lenders, some may recall, were the first to fall in what eventually totaled 388 casualties. A year earlier, to much less fanfare, Jack Dean launched another website in anticipation of the different kind of wave washing up on the California coastline. Called the Pension Tsunami, the website was originally conceived to provide Golden State taxpayers with a one-stop resource to track news stories on the state's mammoth and numerous underfunded public pensions. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Dean came about his inspiration honestly: \"I started tracking this issue in 2004 after the Orange County Board of Supervisors gave a retroactive pension formula increase of 62 percent to county employees,\" he said. \"I was stunned. It's the main reason Orange County has a $4.5 billion underfunded liability today.\" As the years have passed, though, the site has become a font of information for states and municipalities nationwide as well as corporate pensions. In all, over 40,000 headlines have been posted to the website to date. On a recent Friday, Dean posted multiple stories on the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's largest pension program, as well as a budget cliff facing San Francisco, six Los Angeles public safety officers who collected over $1 million apiece last year in pensions, and eight cities that could face bankruptcy when the next recession hits.

Source: Bloomberg \u200b Federal Reserve data show that in 1952, the average public pension had 96 percent of its portfolio invested in bonds and cash equivalents. Assets matched future liabilities. But a loosening of state laws in the 1980s opened the door to riskier investments. In 1992, fixed income and cash had fallen to an average of 47 percent of holdings. By 2016, these safe investments had declined to 27 percent. It's no coincidence that pensions' flight from safety has coincided with the drop in interest rates. That said, unlike their private peers, public pensions discount their liabilities using the rate of returns they assume their overall portfolio will generate. In fiscal 2016, which ended June 30th, the average return for public pensions was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 percent. Corporations' accounting rules dictate the use of more realistic bond yields to discount their pensions' future liabilities. Put differently, companies have been forced to set aside something closer to what it will really cost to service their obligations as opposed to the fantasy figures allowed among public pensions. So why not just flip the switch and require truth and honesty in public pension math? Too many cities and potentially states would buckle under the weight of more realistic assumed rates of return. By some estimates, unfunded liabilities would triple to upwards of $6 trillion if the prevailing yields on Treasuries were used. That would translate into much steeper funding requirements at a time when budgets are already severely constrained. Pockets of the country would face essential public service budgets being slashed to dangerous levels. What's a pension to do? Increasingly, the answer is swing for the fences. Forget the fact that just under half of pension assets are in the second-most overvalued stock market in history. Even as Fed officials publicly fret about commercial real estate valuations, pensions have socked away eight percent of their portfolios into this less than liquid asset class. Even further out on the risk and liquidity spectrum is the 10 percent that pensions have allocated to private equity and limited partnerships. For the better part of a decade, New Albion Partners Chief Market Strategist Brian Reynolds has tracked pensions' allocations to these so-called alternative investments, and the total is approaching $350 billion. The working assumption is that the Pension Tsunami will never make land fall, but the next time you take comfort in the sanctity of pensions given they have yet to self-destruct, ask yourself instead how they are hedged in the event of a correction.

In late 2006, Aaron Krowne, a computer scientist and mathematician, started a website that documented the real-time destruction of the subprime mortgage lending industry. The Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter caught on like wildfire with financial market voyeurs, regularly reaching 100,000 visitors. West Coast lenders, some may recall, were the first to fall in what eventually totaled 388 casualties. A year earlier, to much less fanfare, Jack Dean launched another website in anticipation of the different kind of wave washing up on the California coastline. Called the Pension Tsunami, the website was originally conceived to provide Golden State taxpayers with a one-stop resource to track news stories on the state's mammoth and numerous underfunded public pensions. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Dean came about his inspiration honestly: \"I started tracking this issue in 2004 after the Orange County Board of Supervisors gave a retroactive pension formula increase of 62 percent to county employees,\" he said. \"I was stunned. It's the main reason Orange County has a $4.5 billion underfunded liability today.\" As the years have passed, though, the site has become a font of information for states and municipalities nationwide as well as corporate pensions. In all, over 40,000 headlines have been posted to the website to date. On a recent Friday, Dean posted multiple stories on the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's largest pension program, as well as a budget cliff facing San Francisco, six Los Angeles public safety officers who collected over $1 million apiece last year in pensions, and eight cities that could face bankruptcy when the next recession hits.

In this post, we'll look at 2 more examples of pension schemes that let retirees down. The first is\u2026 2. The National Bus Employees Superannuation Trust In the 80s, Margaret Thatcher's government was busy privatizing Britain's state-run services. One company they broke up and privatized was the National Bus Company , which had a particularly excellent employee pension plan. This NBS's pension plan was aptly called BEST: the Bus Employees' Superannuation Trust . Bus drivers and bus crews were often victims of assaults, violence, stress and more \u200a\u2014 \u200aso BEST was generous, and allowed for early retirement. As a result of this, the BEST fund had a sizeable surplus at the time it was privatized. The idea was for this surplus to improve retirees' pensions. To that end, BEST had an extra \u00a3168 million , paid by bus drivers and bus crews, to distribute among retirees. That's a lot of money\u200a \u2014 \u200abut what happened next was both unfortunate and criminal. Seeing the excess \u00a3168 million , the government decided to pocket it prior to privatization. It had undersold the National Bus Company by \u00a3300 million , so this was its way of making up some of the losses. Put more simply, the British government sold off a national company\u2026 But only after gutting its pension fund and taking \u00a3168 million from current and future pensioners. Now, to be fair, Margaret Thatcher's government only took the surplus money from BEST's beneficiaries. To be even more fair, a 13-year legal and political campaign did end in the Labour Government agreeing to return the money. But all of that is little consolation. The state had raided the BEST fund and gutted it on a whim. The National Bus Company employees had to rely on Britain's national pension\u200a \u2014 \u200aone of the worst-funded in the world\u200a \u2014\u200a instead. And that's the second time a major pension scheme collapsed, leaving millions worse off. Even developed states can and do take money from pensioners like Britain did in the above example. Things are even worse for underdeveloped states\u200a \u2014 \u200aas you're about to see in the next example. 3. How USSR's Pensioners Ended Up Penniless The USSR was a communist nation, meaning everyone worked for the state or a state-owned company \u200a\u2014\u200aand could count on a state pension after retirement. Unfortunately, the USSR dissolved in 1991 , leaving its successor state (Russia) to make good on its obligations. How did this go for Russia's pensioners? Well, after World War 2 , the USSR was the other superpower. You'd think that the people who helped build the state would enjoy some of its past prosperity \u200a\u2014 \u200aeven during an economic downturn. And you'd be wrong. By the time the USSR dissolved, inflation was running wild and national reserves were empty. There was no money to give state retirees. So around 1992\u20131993, the average Russian pensioner got 5\u201315 USD per month . By 1995 , the situation improved\u2026 With pensioners receiving 50 USD per month. Then came Russia's 1998 default when things got worse again, with pensions regressing to 19 USD. At the end of it all, tens of millions of pensioners were living below the poverty line. And this is not to mention that pensions often went unpaid, with the government's debt to pensioners standing at 17 trillion Russian Rubles by 1997 . By sheer magnitude, this is probably the biggest collapse on this list. USSR's workers had no choice but to work for the state. The state was their only source of post-retirement income. And in the end, it failed them completely and unexpectedly. In the next part of our post, we'll look at an ancient example of unpaid pensions, then go back to cover modern America's biggest collapsed private pension fund.

The National Bus Employees Superannuation Trust In the 80s, Margaret Thatcher's government was busy privatizing Britain's state-run services. One company they broke up and privatized was the National Bus Company , which had a particularly excellent employee pension plan. This NBS's pension plan was aptly called BEST: the Bus Employees' Superannuation Trust . Bus drivers and bus crews were often victims of assaults, violence, stress and more \u200a\u2014 \u200aso BEST was generous, and allowed for early retirement. As a result of this, the BEST fund had a sizeable surplus at the time it was privatized. The idea was for this surplus to improve retirees' pensions. To that end, BEST had an extra \u00a3168 million , paid by bus drivers and bus crews, to distribute among retirees. That's a lot of money\u200a \u2014 \u200abut what happened next was both unfortunate and criminal. Seeing the excess \u00a3168 million , the government decided to pocket it prior to privatization. It had undersold the National Bus Company by \u00a3300 million , so this was its way of making up some of the losses. Put more simply, the British government sold off a national company\u2026 But only after gutting its pension fund and taking \u00a3168 million from current and future pensioners. Now, to be fair, Margaret Thatcher's government only took the surplus money from BEST's beneficiaries. To be even more fair, a 13-year legal and political campaign did end in the Labour Government agreeing to return the money. But all of that is little consolation. The state had raided the BEST fund and gutted it on a whim. The National Bus Company employees had to rely on Britain's national pension\u200a \u2014 \u200aone of the worst-funded in the world\u200a \u2014\u200a instead. And that's the second time a major pension scheme collapsed, leaving millions worse off. Even developed states can and do take money from pensioners like Britain did in the above example. Things are even worse for underdeveloped states\u200a \u2014 \u200aas you're about to see in the next example. 3. How USSR's Pensioners Ended Up Penniless The USSR was a communist nation, meaning everyone worked for the state or a state-owned company \u200a\u2014\u200aand could count on a state pension after retirement. Unfortunately, the USSR dissolved in 1991 , leaving its successor state (Russia) to make good on its obligations. How did this go for Russia's pensioners? Well, after World War 2 , the USSR was the other superpower. You'd think that the people who helped build the state would enjoy some of its past prosperity \u200a\u2014 \u200aeven during an economic downturn. And you'd be wrong. By the time the USSR dissolved, inflation was running wild and national reserves were empty. There was no money to give state retirees. So around 1992\u20131993, the average Russian pensioner got 5\u201315 USD per month . By 1995 , the situation improved\u2026 With pensioners receiving 50 USD per month. Then came Russia's 1998 default when things got worse again, with pensions regressing to 19 USD. At the end of it all, tens of millions of pensioners were living below the poverty line. And this is not to mention that pensions often went unpaid, with the government's debt to pensioners standing at 17 trillion Russian Rubles by 1997 . By sheer magnitude, this is probably the biggest collapse on this list. USSR's workers had no choice but to work for the state. The state was their only source of post-retirement income. And in the end, it failed them completely and unexpectedly. In the next part of our post, we'll look at an ancient example of unpaid pensions, then go back to cover modern America's biggest collapsed private pension fund.

In this final part, we'll change things up by looking at a historical example of pension fund failure . We'll also cover what happens when a private company decides (or has no choice but) to stop paying pensions . 4. Ancient Rome Modern pensions are a new invention. However, past cultures \u200a\u2014 \u200aespecially warrior cultures\u200a \u2014 \u200aalso had pensions for soldiers . From Ancient Rome 's soldier-pensioners to Napoleon 's demi soldes , it's never been uncommon for soldier retirees to get governmental support. Just take Ancient Rome . From the 5th century BC, a soldier discharged honorably (with an honesta missio ) was entitled to several things, one of which was a pension . A full pension package included money, Roman citizenship and permission to marry a Roman ( conubium ). Together, these benefits became very enticing, and encouraged an ever-growing number of young men to serve. Unfortunately, the Roman empire eventually couldn't fund its pension obligations. Its currency devalued, inflation was high, and government pensions lost their luster. Thus collapsed the Roman national pension scheme\u200a \u2014\u200a leading, some believe, to the empire's ultimate demise. Last but not least, let's look at a different example. This case is unique, because pensioners were protected by their employer and the government\u2026 And lost their pension fund anyway. Here's how. 5. The United Airlines Bankruptcy The United States Government has guaranteed pensions since the 1970s . However, the United Airlines bankruptcy is an excellent example that government protection isn't everything \u2014 \u200aeven when coupled with working for a big corporation. Here's what happened. United Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002 . The government bailed it out, but to make the numbers add up, UA had to default on many of its obligations. One of the things they defaulted on was over $9 bn of pension obligations . Usually, this wouldn't be possible, but the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation absorbed the obligations , albeit at a large discount. What this meant, in laymen's terms, was that over 130,000 UA employees were left with as little as 50% of the money they were promised. It didn't matter that they worked for a large corporation in a cash-rich industry. It didn't matter that the US government \"guarantees\" pensions. As with all the examples above, pensioners were left with far less than promised. And there you have it.

Like the prices for everyday goods and services were going up a lot more quickly than inflation numbers suggest? If so, you're not alone . Many people, especially young people, find that they can't afford things that used to be consumer economy staple s \u200a\u2014 \u200aincluding home ownership . That's why an increasing number of young adults , from Japan's parasite singles to America's boomerang kids , is choosing to live with their parents to save money. But despite what some older people say, it's not that millennials are lazy and entitled. It's just that life is getting a lot more expensive than inflation tells us. Case in point: Helaine Olen 's book, Pound Foolish , shows that US families used to put 50% of their discretionary income towards housing, healthcare and education. In the 2000s , the respective figure was 75% , leaving just 25% for everything else. And it's not just the staples that are getting more expensive. From clothes to fast food to a drink at your favorite bar, things cost a lot more now than they did 5\u201310 years ago . In the first part of this 3-part series , we'll explain why this is happening. In parts 2 and 3, we'll focus on the truth about inflation, and look at how cars, clothes and homes are all significantly more expensive than they were for our parents. Let's start by going over the real, sometimes misleading, definition of inflation. What is Inflation, Really? The first order of business is to understand what inflation really is. Many people think that inflation measures how much a static basket of products changes in price over time\u200a \u2014 \u200a but this is wrong . In reality, inflation figures show how much the average household's spending changes year-on-year. In the US , these spending figures show up in the Customer Price Index . In the EU , they show up in the HCIP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) . But although the HCIP , CPI and other indices track a broad basket of items across different categories, they don't show us the specific products people are buying. This can mask a lot of inflation \u200a\u2014\u200a and here's how. Let's say it's 2018 and the entire state of Arizona buys bread for $1.20 . The brand they buy is called Arizona Bread and everyone loves it. But by this time next year, the price of Arizona Bread goes up to $1.50\u200a \u2014 \u200aso everyone switches to the cheaper (and less delicious) Oklahoma Loaf brand. Now, the way a regular consumer might look at it, bread just got 20% more expensive . But if you look at inflation figures , they might show you 0% inflation because the price of bread stayed the same. And that's what inflation is. A change in spending; not a change in the price of specific products. It's very important to understand this distinction, because the way inflation is calculated masks price shifts that make consumers switch to cheaper products. Unfortunately, this is just one of several reasons it's hard to gauge inflation accurately. In fact, for you and hundreds of millions of consumers, inflation can be drastically higher than statistics suggest. In the next part of this series, we'll explain why this is the case and take a look at 2 alternative inflation figures: the gold standard and the Big Mac index (yes, the Big Mac index).

You can read all about it here \u2014 but the gist is this. Inflation doesn't track prices for products over time. It just tracks changes in household spending, without reflecting whether an individual product got more expensive or not. Here's how this can (and does) disguise real-life inflation. In the EU , wages have been falling for 10 years . The UK , Portugal , Greece , Hungary and other countries have seen theirs fall every year since 2009 . The EU's largest economies \u200a\u2014 \u200a France and Germany \u2014\u200a have been doing a little better, but have also seen wages fall consistently since 2014 . Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic , annual US wages have only risen once since 2009 \u200a \u2014\u200a and the middle class has lost 30% of its wealth. In short, median incomes have fallen . Because of this, consumers can't afford to spend more . As a result, household spending \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand inflation \u2014 \u200aare both highly stable . This is the first (and biggest) reason inflation isn't higher. The second reason is that consumer price indices are subjective, and change over time. For example, in 2005 , housing costs were weighted at about 25% \u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that number has now risen to 40% . This means that homes are more expensive, but it also means consumer indices allot more money to housing costs, pushing down nominal inflation. In another example, the CPI weighs healthcare at just 8.6% when the US actually spends 18% of its GDP on medicine. This has a similar effect, reducing inflation figures while still leaving consumers with far less disposable income. So how far apart is nominal and real-life inflation? To get a realistic idea, let's look at 2 famous alternative price indices and their rate of inflation. 2 Alternative Price Indices In this section, we'll look at 2 alternative price indices . Unlike the USA's CPI and the EU's HCI P, these indices measure the price of 2 in-demand commodities: Big Macs and gold . This makes them more concrete, if less balanced, than the CPI and HCIP . We'll start with gold , which cost under $800 in Q3 2007 \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand now costs over $1300 (after a short-term peak in 2011\u20132013). That's a 62.5% price difference, or an annualized 4.9% . That may not seem like much\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut when you compare it to the EU's official 1.5% or the US's 1.8%-2.1% , the difference is substantial. Now, you could argue that gold is an important commodity\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut a poor way to measure price changes over time. And that's a fair point, so let's look at our second index: that of the Big Mac . In 2012 , a stateside Big Ma c cost $4.33 . A French Big Mac cost $4.36 . 6 years later (2017) , these prices rose to $5.3 and $5.1 respectively. That's an annual Big Mac inflation rate of 4.1% for the US and 3.2% for the EU : nothing criminal, but far from official inflation rates . Again, these two indices are very subjective. But if both a fast food staple and gold are appreciating faster than inflation suggests, who's to say the same isn't happening for other assets and commodities? That's right. Nobody .

You can read all about it here \u2014 but the gist is this. Inflation doesn't track prices for products over time. It just tracks changes in household spending, without reflecting whether an individual product got more expensive or not. Here's how this can (and does) disguise real-life inflation. In the EU , wages have been falling for 10 years . The UK , Portugal , Greece , Hungary and other countries have seen theirs fall every year since 2009 . The EU's largest economies \u200a\u2014 \u200a France and Germany \u2014\u200a have been doing a little better, but have also seen wages fall consistently since 2014 . Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic , annual US wages have only risen once since 2009 \u200a \u2014\u200a and the middle class has lost 30% of its wealth. In short, median incomes have fallen . Because of this, consumers can't afford to spend more . As a result, household spending \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand inflation \u2014 \u200aare both highly stable . This is the first (and biggest) reason inflation isn't higher. The second reason is that consumer price indices are subjective, and change over time. For example, in 2005 , housing costs were weighted at about 25% \u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that number has now risen to 40% . This means that homes are more expensive, but it also means consumer indices allot more money to housing costs, pushing down nominal inflation. In another example, the CPI weighs healthcare at just 8.6% when the US actually spends 18% of its GDP on medicine. This has a similar effect, reducing inflation figures while still leaving consumers with far less disposable income. So how far apart is nominal and real-life inflation? To get a realistic idea, let's look at 2 famous alternative price indices and their rate of inflation. 2 Alternative Price Indices In this section, we'll look at 2 alternative price indices . Unlike the USA's CPI and the EU's HCI P, these indices measure the price of 2 in-demand commodities: Big Macs and gold . This makes them more concrete, if less balanced, than the CPI and HCIP . We'll start with gold , which cost under $800 in Q3 2007 \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand now costs over $1300 (after a short-term peak in 2011\u20132013). That's a 62.5% price difference, or an annualized 4.9% . That may not seem like much\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut when you compare it to the EU's official 1.5% or the US's 1.8%-2.1% , the difference is substantial. Now, you could argue that gold is an important commodity\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut a poor way to measure price changes over time. And that's a fair point, so let's look at our second index: that of the Big Mac . In 2012 , a stateside Big Ma c cost $4.33 . A French Big Mac cost $4.36 . 6 years later (2017) , these prices rose to $5.3 and $5.1 respectively. That's an annual Big Mac inflation rate of 4.1% for the US and 3.2% for the EU : nothing criminal, but far from official inflation rates . Again, these two indices are very subjective. But if both a fast food staple and gold are appreciating faster than inflation suggests, who's to say the same isn't happening for other assets and commodities? That's right. Nobody . Looking at these numbers, it's a little hard to believe that inflation is as low as OECD governments say it is\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that's not all.

This time, we're going to look at specific examples of goods and services appreciating a lot faster than we think. Specifically, we'll look at cars , homes , education and clothes , all of which have gotten a lot more expensive in the last decade. First on our list are\u2026 Clothes In the last couple of decades , we've seen a boom of \"fast fashion\" brands like Zara , H&M and Topshop . Anecdotally, shoppers know that as recently as 5\u20137 years ago, it was difficult to find an item priced at $100 in any of these brands' offerings. Today, though, fast fashion price points of $100 , $200 and $300 are all common. In other words, fast fashion quickly went from a cheap alternative to high-end brands to being fairly expensive . And if you look at other fashion segments, you'll see a similar change . Next up, let's look at cars . Cars In the late 20th century US , a car was a staple rather than a luxury . Anecdotally, most median-income households could buy a car by sticking to the 20/4/10 rule : 20% of your income on a down payment, then 10% of your income to pay for interest and insurance over 4 years. Today, things are very different. Using the 20/4/10 rule, a median Miami resident has $13,577 to buy a car. For comparison, the average new car actually costs $35,368 . That's a big gap, and it shows that new cars\u200a \u2014\u200a heck, all cars \u200a\u2014 \u200aare now out of reach for the median American . (In other countries, where cars tend to be more expensive, things are often worse, with cars being completely out of the question for many families.) Now let's move on to another important cost: that of owning or renting a home. Homes In much of the developed world , homes have never been more expensive . A 1940 home would cost the average American family $2,938 . Adjusted for inflation, that's under $40,000 in today's dollars. But today, an actual U.S. home costs well over $200,000 ; a 500% difference after you adjust for inflation . Clearly, homes are far more expensive than inflation numbers suggest. A similar pattern emerges in Europe . In countries like Italy , France and Spain , the house price:disposable income ratio has gone up by 50% or more in the last 2 decades . Europeans have never paid so much for homes; same as Americans. Last but not least, let's talk about\u2026 Education In the United States , college fees have appreciated 4x faster than the CPI since the 1940s . This means that, once again, inflation figures don't capture the extent to which education has become more expensive. In Europe , things are a little better. Nordic countries and welfare states like Belgium and France still offer education for relatively little money. But in other countries, fees can go up very quickly (and unexpectedly). Case in point: the UK famously tripled university fees in 2013\u20132014 , and Ireland's university fees are currently in line with the US's . In short, education is getting more expensive on both sides of the ocean\u200a\u2014\u200aand at a far greater speed than inflation figures suggest. And there you have it. Although official inflation figures are low, everything is getting more expensive\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.

A blockchain is a data storage approach that can be described as a growing list (or ledger) of records that are stored in blocks which are linked using cryptography. Reading data from the blockchain is permissionless and open for everyone while the creation of a new block is controlled by decentralized consensus. At the moment, there are many consensus algorithms under investigation but only two are really used in practice by major blockchain networks: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). A Proof-of-work algorithm was originally developed for e-mail spam protection project Hashcash , but the only launch of the Bitcoin network brought this concept to a wide public. The key idea of PoW is probabilistic right to creation of a new block based on a share of contributed computational work that can be easily verified. Such a principle enables competition of workers (or miners) for block creation and ensures network by economic mechanism: for attacking the network malefactor have to buy a huge amount of computational facilities that are expensive (and expensiveness of necessary amount of hardware is correlated with the total network hash power). The Proof-of-Stake idea is based on a simple competition of coin holders for block creation: more coins are on a wallet balance, the bigger is probability to create a new block. If someone wants to attack the network, he needs to buy a lot of coins what is expensive (and the cost is correlated with the network capitalization). By the way, what is motivation to attack a network in which you are the whale and own a lot of coins? :) With blockchain technology, there is no centralized entity that controls everything. The decentralization gives it a number of unique properties that are not inherent to other data storage approaches. These include resistance to data modification, the ability to operate in an entirely untrusted environment, and a high level of security and privacy. They allow the creation of different p2p networks and completely new business models that were impossible to imagine before. The biggest and oldest blockchain network is well-known Bitcoin. The famous p2p \u201celectronic cash\u201d system, as it was defined by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto, helps people all over the world to transfer from $1 bln to $2 bln in assets daily safely, reliably and independent from any third parties such as banks and government structures. Further important applications of blockchain technology beyond the transfer of value are decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed computing, and different social applications. Projects based on blockchain technology allows people to use services previously offered only by centralized corporations with a completely new user experience such as high levels of data privacy, reliability, and safety from third-party actions. Such projects form a new layer of the internet known as web3 , which \u2013 as opposed to web2 \u2013 is focused on the needs of end-users, not corporations. What is crypto? The \u201cCrypto\u201d term was initially invented to specify a new type of currencies whose issuance and operation are based on blockchain technology and protected by cryptography. Lately, \u201ccrypto\u201d or the \u201ccrypto industry\u201d have become synonymous to the \u201cblockchain industry.\u201d The history of crypto began on 31 October 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper . Several months later, the first Bitcoin block was mined, and the network started growing. During the first five years of network operation, Bitcoin survived a lot of ups and downs of its price, a hack of the major exchange \u2013 Mt.Gox \u2013 and attracted millions of enthusiasts that started to support the growing industry in different ways such as development, mining and spreading the information. More recently, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood introduced Ethereum , a distributed computer and operating system that supports smart-contracts and, therefore, allows to build a variety of new applications that are not limited to p2p payments like Bitcoin. It also enabled the creation of a new asset class \u2013 tokens. Tokens are digital assets, issued on a blockchain. Tokens can be stores of value but also enable vital services and governance within blockchain projects while not requiring their own, native blockchain protocol. The most popular standard for token issuing at the present moment is Ethereum-based ERC20 , used by the majority of decentralized applications (dApps) nowadays. Furthermore, there are other popular cryptocurrencies that include Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011 as a Bitcoin fork, Monero, EOS, Dash and many others. By 2017, the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies went through a hype period that resulted in a large speculative bubble, which burst in subsequent months and led to stark price drops in 2018-2019. Nevertheless, during the 2017-2019 period, the blockchain industry made a significant step forward and now is presented by dozens of projects that are successfully operating and serving customers at different markets, such as finance, gambling, advertising, and social networks. At the present moment, in the middle of 2019, the crypto industry is boiling up with new projects promising to transform more industries. They are building the foundation and first applications of a new digital world: one based on user-centered business models and a new level of people cooperation. As the crypto industry develops, it is solving two key challenges. The first is scalability: current technological standards do not allow enough transactions to become the foundation for global industries. For example, while Proof-of-Work builds consensus based on energy-intensive computations, Proof-of-Stake features \u2018staking\u2019, a type of accountability for reliable information, as a consensus builder, which is more scalable. Further approaches attempt to reduce the load on the main blockchain by opening up parallel, intertwined forms of information exchange, like state channels and plasma . Meanwhile, at the user end, blockchain-based applications are making interfaces ever more friendly to non-experts. Different projects are competing to improve user interfaces and interoperability, allowing individuals to get the upsides of crypto services without having to change their habits significantly.","title":"Round 1"},{"location":"old/quest/round1/#round-1","text":"","title":"Round 1"},{"location":"old/quest/round1/#what-is-blockchain","text":"A blockchain is a data storage approach that can be described as a growing list (or ledger) of records that are stored in blocks which are linked using cryptography.

Lately, \u201ccrypto\u201d or the \u201ccrypto industry\u201d have become synonymous to the \u201cblockchain industry.\u201d The history of crypto began on 31 October 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper . Several months later, the first Bitcoin block was mined, and the network started growing. During the first five years of network operation, Bitcoin survived a lot of ups and downs of its price, a hack of the major exchange \u2013 Mt.Gox \u2013 and attracted millions of enthusiasts that started to support the growing industry in different ways such as development, mining and spreading the information. More recently, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood introduced Ethereum , a distributed computer and operating system that supports smart-contracts and, therefore, allows to build a variety of new applications that are not limited to p2p payments like Bitcoin. It also enabled the creation of a new asset class \u2013 tokens. Tokens are digital assets, issued on a blockchain. Tokens can be stores of value but also enable vital services and governance within blockchain projects while not requiring their own, native blockchain protocol. The most popular standard for token issuing at the present moment is Ethereum-based ERC20 , used by the majority of decentralized applications (dApps) nowadays. Furthermore, there are other popular cryptocurrencies that include Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011 as a Bitcoin fork, Monero, EOS, Dash and many others. By 2017, the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies went through a hype period that resulted in a large speculative bubble, which burst in subsequent months and led to stark price drops in 2018-2019. Nevertheless, during the 2017-2019 period, the blockchain industry made a significant step forward and now is presented by dozens of projects that are successfully operating and serving customers at different markets, such as finance, gambling, advertising, and social networks. At the present moment, in the middle of 2019, the crypto industry is boiling up with new projects promising to transform more industries. They are building the foundation and first applications of a new digital world: one based on user-centered business models and a new level of people cooperation. As the crypto industry develops, it is solving two key challenges. The first is scalability: current technological standards do not allow enough transactions to become the foundation for global industries. For example, while Proof-of-Work builds consensus based on energy-intensive computations, Proof-of-Stake features \u2018staking\u2019, a type of accountability for reliable information, as a consensus builder, which is more scalable. Further approaches attempt to reduce the load on the main blockchain by opening up parallel, intertwined forms of information exchange, like state channels and plasma . Meanwhile, at the user end, blockchain-based applications are making interfaces ever more friendly to non-experts. Different projects are competing to improve user interfaces and interoperability, allowing individuals to get the upsides of crypto services without having to change their habits significantly.","title":"What is blockchain?"},{"location":"old/quest/round2/","text":"Round 2 Introduction The main advantage of blockchain technology is a possibility to build applications that are permissionless, reliable, seamlessly interoperable, censorship-resistant, and independent from third-party activity.

The Internet allowed people to seamlessly communicate and produce something together regardless of their location and, therefore, significantly increased the efficiency of human collaboration. It led to widespread digital communities that pursue shared goals and often manage collectively owned resources. One of the most daunting problems these communities faced is governance. The management of a community distributed worldwide is not an easy task, especially taking into account the absence of legal frameworks and possible mutual mistrust between members who never meet in person and can hide behind nicknames.

Blockchain technology allowed the development of governance frameworks for digital communities which are based on the principle \u201cthe code is law\u201d and can successfully operate in an entirely trustless environment. The \u201ccode as law\u201d approach leads to the automatization of the management of digital communities and ensures that all decisions and actions will be done on the basis of the defined ruleset and in the interests of the majority. Currently, such blockchain-based organizations that are represented by computer code and not influenced by a central government are defined as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, discussed the DAO concept and its variations in 2014 before the Ethereum network was launched. The DASH network became the first live DAO in 2015 by implementing a shared finance pool for ecosystem development, with allocation managed by owners of master nodes. The first large-scale DAO experiment started in May 2016, called \u201cThe DAO\u201d project. It collected $150 mln in ether during crowdfunding and set a new world crowdfunding record. However, an attack on the DAO on 17 June led to the theft of 3.6 mln of ether by an anonymous hacker. It prompted an Ethereum hardfork to return the stolen money to investors.

The informal economy can be defined as the set of economic activities, such as businesses or jobs, that are not regulated or protected by the state. The term originally applied to unregistered self-employment and small enterprises. Today, the informal economy sector includes remittances, mutual savings, and investment activity, as well as any kind of unregistered business or goods production. It includes more than 60% of the global workforce and 90% of micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The phenomenon is common both in developed and developing countries, with a tendency to take a more significant share in developing countries. Generally, a lower level of economic opportunity and state stability leads more citizens to take care of their money, jobs, and businesses by themselves. In South Asia, approximately 80-90% of the workforce is employed in the informal sector; for example, in Bangladesh, this indicator is ~89% based on results of research published by the Asian Development Bank. In the majority of African countries, the situation is pretty similar . People are not only using the informal sector for jobs and businesses, but also for basic financial needs such as savings. One intriguing phenomenon of the informal economy is the formation of informal savings groups, which exist in 73 countries across the globe. Informal savings groups play a crucial role in the daily life of people from certain countries of Africa, South Asia, and South America. In the presence of an unstable banking system and untrusted and corrupted government, people prefer to take care of all financial activities by themselves and rely only on services based on social trust. These structural problems are relatively widespread in developing countries. The most studied region where savings groups are widely used is the sub-Saharan region of Africa. For example, in Kenya savings groups are called \u201cChamas\u201d, which means \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cbody\u201d in Kiswahili, the national language. A Chama is an offline cooperative group of 15-25 members created for collective savings and investments and based only on social trust. \u201cChamas\u201d are widespread - only in Kenya, there are more than 300,000 Chamas holding more than $3.5 bln in assets. In different countries, informal savings groups have their own local names but the core principles are the same. Individuals put their savings together and invest jointly in projects, lend out money to members, and collectively manage the funds. The groups often come together around one goal, such as saving to acquire land or production inputs, and they promote financial discipline and mutual support mechanisms. Members tend to point out the outstanding stability and effectiveness of such social organizations. In the Akropolis network, the broader term \u201cautonomous financial organization\u201d (AFO) is used to incorporate savings groups and other forms of collective financial organizations. We are trying to provide a flexible and seamlessly customizable solution that can be used by savings groups, cooperatives and other forms of mutual community-based organizations all over the world. An autonomous financial organization (AFO) is a self-sovereign, digital, member-owned organization that provides financial services such as co-saving and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, and a basic form of insurance. The AFO concept covers not only informal savings groups in developing countries but also other types of cooperative organizations used in such countries like the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. Common examples are mutuals (UK, Germany), Broodfonds (Netherlands) and cooperatives.

The global economy is on the verge of another global financial crisis with the global pensions deficit, meaning the total outstanding pensions liabilities to people, including all asset classes, currently at $78 trillion.

However, according to some estimates, the fiscal gap may be up to ten times greater. Total world debt is estimated to be as high as $244 trillion.

More precisely, we look at the ways people have used to protect each other and maintain a social contract to preserve and multiply their wealth before the existence of modern-day financial institutions. The answer lies in self-sovereignty through the ability to protect one's savings and in growth through trust-based communities as a source of support, informal credit, and emergency social insurance.

A DPO (Direct Premium Offering) is a fundraising approach based on offering tokens of a project to contributors on a cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange performs the whole fundraising cycle. Individuals interested in acquiring the token in its initial offering go through the exchange and can trade the token immediately thereafter. In order to mitigate periods of extreme volatility when the market opens, and to reduce the risk of adverse impacts on investors, there is a period of tiered price limits. The concept is similar to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) but includes the immediate listing of the token, thus much more closely mirroring Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on traditional stock exchanges. It presents the next iteration in crypto\u2019s journey to offer reliable crowdfunding mechanisms for promising projects. More information about the details of the DPO process can be found here . A brief history of crowdfunding options. Crowdfunding through the internet became a popular and powerful new fundraising options through centralized platforms such as famous Kickstarter.com. Kickstarter and similar services allowed people from all over the world to offer new ideas and products, raise money for product development, or invest money in something promising. The approach unlocked the potential of the internet\u2019s broad accessibility to create a financial P2P application that offered new opportunities outside ordinary banking credit or VC funding. It allowed the flourishing of a variety of new physical products and digital services. More recently, blockchain technology enabled a more decentralized fundraising process, leading to the appearance of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) concept. An ICO features community contributions in cryptocurrency to a project that is seeking funding in exchange for the native token used in the new project. The main advantages of ICOs are the possibility to contribute or attract funds from all over the world without barriers (although, from the legal side, there are significant restrictions in some jurisdictions like the USA), trade tokens whose value is linked to the project development after the ICO and fund projects that cannot be funded in other ways. The first project funded using ICO approach was Mastercoin , which was re-branded to OmniLayer , a protocol for Tether USD (USDT) issuance and operation. Several of the most notable projects in the industry, including Ethereum, EOS, and Binance were funded using ICOs. According to icodata statistics, during 2017 and 2018, ICO projects collected more than $14 bln. However, the ICO process also has a lot of drawbacks: a big percentage of fraudulent projects, a mess in regulation that sometimes results in offering unregistered securities to retail investors, and the absence of trusted due diligence and project scoring. At the present moment, ICOs have fallen out of favor as a trusted and reliable funding approach. In response to the fall of ICOs, the Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) emerged as a new favorite in the industry to conduct crowdfunding for promising projects. A key upside is that an exchange acts as the due diligence agent, doing their own research on projects, and selecting only the ones they trust. An IEO is also more convenient for contributors as they can use funds from their deposits at the exchange for contribution and be sure that token will be listed in a short time. For projects, it is a possibility to focus on project development while a significant share of fundraising activities will be carried out by an exchange. Thus, it is a more effective and safe fundraising approach for all parties in comparison with ICO.","title":"Round 6"},{"location":"old/quest/round6/#round-6","text":"","title":"Round 6"},{"location":"old/quest/round6/#what-is-dpo-or-prime-offering","text":"A DPO (Direct Premium Offering) is a fundraising approach based on offering tokens of a project to contributors on a cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange performs the whole fundraising cycle. Individuals interested in acquiring the token in its initial offering go through the exchange and can trade the token immediately thereafter. In order to mitigate periods of extreme volatility when the market opens, and to reduce the risk of adverse impacts on investors, there is a period of tiered price limits. The concept is similar to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) but includes the immediate listing of the token, thus much more closely mirroring Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on traditional stock exchanges.

This opens up tremendous opportunities for building financial, social and other applications that will be trustless, privacy-oriented and secure. Based on this, the Akropolis team chose to build a product on top of Polkadot along with more than twenty blockchain teams, developing completely different services. So, what will be next?
