### Why Akropolis?

Today, DeFi provides great opportunities for earning money through staking, yield farming and liquidity provision. However, different DeFi protocols offer various opportunities for yield generation & yield farming which may confuse DeFi newbies & people who do not have time to follow the news constantly.

Akropolis allocate different yield-farming & yield-generating pools in one interface, solving an important problem for novice DeFi users - simple & user-friendly interface with concise and understandable information.

Another important feature is the ability to set an automated dollar-cost average (DCA) strategy into assets/liquidity pools - oriented at users who want to set up a long-term portfolio. Akropolis decreases operational costs for such operations as all funds are pooled and batched to minimize gas costs.

Akropolis also gives special attention to UI/UX design to make it simple & understandable for the end-users (novice or experts) - we are constantly improving it & adding more user-friendly features per community feedback and best practices in the space.

### Yearn Vaults

On the Vaults tab you can find the Yearn strategies v1&v2  integrated. This is the automised product to maximase your yield-farming gains. To learn more about Yearn Vaults please visit the [Yearn Documantation and FAQ](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq).

### DCA (in progress)

Dollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and the crypto community. To put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as ‚Äústacking sats‚Äù in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase price/cost basis. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices.

### Stake

Currently, stake tab has only one pool - AKRO staking. Mechanics here are simple - you just send AKRO to this pool & farm AKRO/ADEL. No lock-up. To learn how to stake please visit our [Simple staking FAQ](https://wiki.akropolis.io/simplefaq/)

### What is vesting?

Vesting is a lockup model for incentivizing long-term users and tokenholders. Each day of rewards is locked for 1 year with bi-weekly distributions.
You can find the total vested amount and unlocked amount in [My Rewards](https://akropolis.io/rewards). 
 
Take a note, that rewards distribute after its amount reach 10,000 AKRO and 500 ADEL. The percentage bar in My Rewards displays reaching the threshold for the distribution.

## Akropolis Functionality

### How to allocate liquidity?

- Enable Allocate switcher to choose pools you want to deposit into

- Choose the amount & tokens you would like to put in each pool

- Click the Allocate button to deposit in one transaction (additional transactions may come in a form of ‚Äúapprove spending‚Äù)

- That‚Äôs it. Your funds are sent to corresponding pools/strategies where they earn yield & farm tokens.

### What's "Add all coins in a balanced proportion"?

Each liquidity pool has a balanced ratio for assets within it - by depositing tokens in a balanced proportion, you decrease the chance of swap (leading to fewer gas fees & swap fees). 

### What's "Infinite unlock"?

Infinite unlock means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of tokens when you interact with it. Enabling infinite unlock means that you approve spending tokens only once (thus reducing gas costs associated with signing ‚Äúapprove‚Äù transaction). Bear in mind - after enabling infinite unlock, all following transfers/deposit of the asset chosen won‚Äôt need approval - so please use it if you fully trust the contract.
