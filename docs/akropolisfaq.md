### Why Akropolis?

Today, the DeFi area provides great opportunities for earning money through staking, yield farming and liquidity provision. Nowadays, different DeFi protocols offer various opportunities for yield generation & yield farming which might confuse DeFi newbies & people who do not have time to follow the news constantly.

Akropolis allocate different yield-farming & yield-generating pools in one interface, solving an important problem for novice DeFi users - simple & user-friendly interface with concise and understandable information.

Another important feature is the ability to set an automated dollar-cost average (DCA) strategy into assets/liquidity pools - oriented at users who want to set up a long-term portfolio. Akropolis decreases operational costs for such operations as all funds are pooled.

We also gave special attention to UI/UX design trying to make it simple & understandable for the end-users (novice or experts) - and are going to constantly improve it & add more user-friendly features as we progress based on feedback and best practices in the space.

### How does it work?

- Connect your wallet.

- Choose one or several pools/vaults that currently provides the best yield farming opportunities.

- Choose if you want to deposit all available funds or Dollar Cost Averaging into those pools.

- Relax.

### Yearn Vaults

### Save

Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once. The savings pools are paused at the moment.

### DCA

Dollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and crypto community. If put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as “stacking sats” in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices.

**Important! DCA are non-stablecoin pools. Higher risk-reward pools with higher volatility — higher potential capital gains and losses.**

## Akropolis Functionality

### How to allocate liquidity?

- Enable Allocate switcher to choose pools you want to deposit into

- Choose amount & tokens in each pool

- Click on Allocate button to deposit in one transaction (additional transactions may come in a form of “approve spending”)

- That’s it. Your funds are sent to corresponding pools/strategies where they earn yield & farm tokens.

### What's "Add all coins in a balanced proportion"?

Each liquidity pool has a balanced ratio for assets within it - by depositing tokens in a balanced proportion, you decrease the chance of swap (leading to fewer gas fees & swap fees). 

### What's "Infinite unlock"?

Infinite unlock means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of tokens when you interact with it. Enabling infinite unlock means that you approve spending tokens only once (thus reducing gas costs associated with signing “approve” transaction). Bear in mind - after enabling infinite unlock, all following transfers/deposit of the asset chosen won’t need approval - so please use it if you fully trust the contract.
