## What is Akropolis?

Akropolis is an Ethereum based platform that enables users to automate earning yield on their crypto-assets. Akropolis is built on Yearn’s vaults and acts as a front-end to the Yearn ecosystem. 


The focus of Akropolis is to onboard retail and institutional users to decentralized finance. The current version of the platform gives users a simple way to navigate Yearn’s products and strategies to earn yields. Akropolis also works closely with the Yearn community to build out custom strategies tailored to the Akropolis user base.
