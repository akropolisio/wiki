### **ADEL Tokenomic**

**Tokenomics are evolving and subject to change**

### Token Utility

Product-level governance for Delphi users and contributors, e.g:

- Further protocol integrations

- What assets/pools to whitelist

- Discount on fees

- Inflation/Deflation

In order to govern Delphi, AKRO tokenholders need to have both AKRO & ADEL, to ensure their interests are fairly represented.

### Value accrual

Value accrual through claim on Delphi fees and utility, not inflation;

ADEL accrues value and is charged with product-specific governance;

ADEL stakers have a major entitlement to Delphi economics (20% AKRO/80%ADEL) (subject to change):

- Exit/entry fees

- Performance fees

- Exchange referral fees

### Sources of Interest

(Potential) Initial sources of yield or gains, more to be added:

- Supply interest from Compound/AAVE/dYdX/bZx

- Trading fees from Curve, Balancer, Uniswap

- CRV, BAL, COMP, SNX, REN etc token mining

- yearn protocol fee (COMP, LEND, etc.)*

### How can I get it?

- Earn by providing liquidity (stablecoins, AKRO or other tokens) to Delphi;

- Earn by participating in Delphi product governance, i.e. voting and creating proposals that pass;
