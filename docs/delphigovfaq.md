# Delphi Governance FAQ

## What can I signal my vote on?

- Delphi product features and integrations

- Delphi fees

- Propose new Vault strategy

- Propose Vault strategy selection / creation framework

## How do I vote?

- Go to the [Akropolis Delphi](https://snapshot.page/#/akropolis-delphi) space on Snapshot (you can do it through [Governance tab](https://delphi.akropolis.io/governance) on Delphi);

- Click on “Connect wallet” button in top right corner;

- Connect to wallet which you use for staking of AKRO or/and ADEL on Delphi;

- Click on the option you want to vote for;

- Sign the message via your wallet and done.

- Voting will be open for 3 days or 72 hours, so if it opens on Wed 1300CET, it will close on Friday 1300CET (approximately, as closing time is set by the block number).

## Workflow

- All proposals should first be discussed over the governance forum. That would give all governance participants an ability to understand all pros & cons before voting. 

- After initial discussion is completed & community agree that it should be officially voted on - team or community members can post it on Snapshot page for voting. And as it’s off-chain voting, it does not require any gas fees :)

- After voting is completed & proposal reaches *percent* quorum, we will add it to our development pipeline.

## How Snapshot works?

- Creating a proposal and voting is free - no actual transaction required, only sign.

- How to create a proposal? Please check [Snapshot docs](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-proposal).

- Proposals and votes are just signed messages stored on IPFS.

- Signatures are easily verifiable online - they use the "eth_sign" format

## Who can create or vote on proposals?

- Only AKRO & ADEL stakers on Delphi can create or vote for proposals. This way we ensure that only active users have a say in Delphi initial governance.

- 1 vote equals 1 ADEL or 83 AKRO staked. Rationale behind such weights: ADEL has a higher weight as it was introduced specifically for Delphi governance, and current weights were decided based on 28 VWAP & current solution in mind. There is no fees or revenue sharing currently in Delphi & gas fees are still high for a lot of people - different weights would mean asking people to migrate to a specific governance pool, which would add more friction.

- Votes from both tokens are summed up, giving your final vote power. For example, 10k ADEL & 83k AKRO staked gives you 20k votes. Here is a simple calculator - just copy it if you wanna check how many tokens you need in staking to reach a certain voting power.

- There is a minimum of 20,000 votes to create a proposal on Snapshot.

- There is no minimum for voting.
