## Pools

### Save

Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once.

### Stake

Mechanics here are simple - you just send token to the chosen pool & farm additional tokens. No lock-up for the staked funds.
