### How does it work?

- Connect your wallet.

- Choose one or several pools that currently provides the best yield farming opportunities.

- Choose if you want to deposit all available funds or Dollar Cost Averaging into those pools.

- Relax.

### Save

Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once.

### Invest

Investments tab is similar to savings with one big difference - all pools contain volatile assets, so risks connected to impermanent loss are much higher. Just choose the pool you’re willing to supply liquidity to & confirm deposit -  chill while your funds earning interest & farming different tokens all at once.

### DCA

Dollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and crypto community. If put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as “stacking sats” in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices.

### Stake

Stake tab has two pools - for AKRO and ADEL staking. Mechanics here are simple - you just send AKRO/ADEL to the chosen pool & farm AKRO&ADEL. No lock-up.

## Delphi Functionality

### How to allocate liquidity?

- Enable Allocate switcher to choose pools you want to deposit into

- Choose amount & tokens in each pool

- Click on Allocate button to deposit in one transaction (additional transactions may come in a form of “approve spending”)

- That’s it. Your funds are sent to corresponding pools where they earn yield & farm tokens.

### What's "Add all coins in a balanced proportion"?

Each liquidity pool has a balanced ratio for assets within it - by depositing tokens in a balanced proportion, you decrease the chance of swap (leading to fewer gas fees & swap fees). 

### What's "Infinite unlock"?

Infinite unlock means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of tokens when you interact with it. Enabling infinite unlock means that you approve spending tokens only once (thus reducing gas costs associated with signing “approve” transaction). Bear in mind - after enabling infinite unlock, all following transfers/deposit of the asset chosen won’t need approval - so please use it if you fully trust the contract. 

### How to withdraw liquidity I provided?

Each strategy option in Akropolis has a withdrawal tab. You can withdraw either in a proportion of pool assets (preferred way as it decreases swap fees) or in a form of individual tokens (with swaps & fees in place).
