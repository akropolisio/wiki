### Save

Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once.

### Stake

Stake tab has one pool - for AKRO staking. Mechanics here are simple - you just send AKRO to the chosen pool & farm AKRO&ADEL. No lock-up for the staked funds.
