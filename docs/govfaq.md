## How do I vote?

- Go to the [Akropolis space](https://snapshot.page/#/akropolis.eth) space on Snapshot (you can do it through [Governance tab](https://akropolis.io/governance) on Akropolis app);

- Click on “Connect wallet” button in top right corner;

- Connect to wallet which you use for staking AKRO;

- Click on the option you want to vote for;

- Sign the message via your wallet and done.

- Voting will be open for 3 days or 72 hours, so if it opens on Wed 1300CET, it will close on Friday 1300CET (approximately, as closing time is set by the block number).

## Workflow

- All proposals should first be discussed over the governance forum. That would give all governance participants an ability to understand all pros & cons before voting.

- After initial discussion is completed & community agree that it should be officially voted on - team or community members can post it on Snapshot page for voting. And as it’s off-chain voting, it does not require any gas fees :)

- After voting is completed & proposal reaches quorum, we will add it to our development pipeline.

## How Snapshot works?

- Creating a proposal and voting is free - no actual transaction required, only sign.

- How to create a proposal? Please check [Snapshot docs](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-proposal).

- Proposals and votes are just signed messages stored on IPFS.

- Signatures are easily verifiable online - they use the "eth_sign" format

## Who can create or vote on proposals?
