## What is Akropolis

Akropolis is a provider of decentralized finance products with an emphasis on asset yield generation. Our mission is to give users (both new and crypto-native) the tools to save, grow and provision for the future safely, with access to a variety of non-fiat and non-inflationary assets, without dependence on geography or central counterparty. To do this, Arkopolis offers an easy-to-use yield aggregator product featuring curated best-in-class yield generation strategies from various protocols across DeFi.

Using the Akropolis dApp, users can:

- Easily onboard into DeFi from their traditional bank accounts via Dharma and Ramp Network.

- Calculate and compare annual percent yield (APY) of various assets across top DeFi yield generating strategies such as Yearn Finance Vaults.

- Easily see their balance, average APY, and yield earned.

- Deposit and withdraw assets and claim yield rewards all in one place.

- Use dollar-cost averaging to enter positions/strategies (coming soon)

- Stake their $AKRO tokens for liquidity mining rewards and protocol revenue share (coming soon).

- Participate in Akropolis protocol governance via Snapshot.

In this way, Akropolis acts as a one-stop-shop for decentralized savings and high-yield accounts. We believe that our products and services will enable retail and institutional clients alike to quickly and easily onboard into decentralized finance.
