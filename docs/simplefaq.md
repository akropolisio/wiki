## What is vesting?

Vesting is a lockup model for incentivizing long-term users and tokenholders. Each day of rewards is locked for 1 year with bi-weekly distributions.
You can find the total vested amount and unlocked amount in [My Rewards](https://akropolis.io/rewards). 
 
Take a note, that rewards distribute after its amount reach 10,000 AKRO and 500 ADEL. The percentage bar in My Rewards displays reaching the threshold for the distribution.
